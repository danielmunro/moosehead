a hellcat~
A large cat prowls around here, its eyes lit with a demonic light.
~
The cat snarls at you, baring its long, sharp fangs, and a jet of flame
curls out of it's nostrils.  Its muscles tense up, in preperation to
pounce.

A stairway into darkness~
As you walk along, an utter silence befalls the area.  You push your
way through some brush, into a foggy clearing, and the branches seal shut
behind you, sealing you within the clearing.  You stumble along and find
yourself standing inside a clearing ringed with huge obsidian pillars, as
if an ancient temple rested on this spot.  An icy wind chills you to the
bone as you search around and discover a stairway leading down into
darkness.  A stone slab is embedded within the ground next to the stairway.
Perhaps it would be prudent to read it before continuing onward.
