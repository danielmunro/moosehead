# Moosehead

Moosehead SLED, haphazardly updated from the original source.  Requires docker.
Use the following to run:

```
$ docker build . -t mhs:latest
$ ./run.sh mhs:latest
```

## Done

* Merge update branches to get MHS running on 64bit architectures, & adds docker.
* CI build pipeline that pushes docker images.

## Todos

* Grok the code
* Clean up all the stuff that is backup/outdated/not needed
* Get an instance up and running
