You have entered something...its cold in here...and hard and theres lots of 
scary things moving around on the floor. You can hear a whispering sound 
coming from all directions. With a sudden terrifying realization, you
remember that last thing that happened to you. Karag gave you a hug. You 
are still within the hug. Thats just weird. Then you remember all the 
sounds of voices and realize Karags hug was not friendly, it was evil and
at this very moment is delivering your soul unto his weapon. If that wasnt 
enough, the things on the floor are clustering around you. Dont try to
make sense of it, just RUN!

{rSyn's Temple of Shenanigans, Tomfoolery and Ballyhoo.{x~
This room is clearly designed for comfort...and, a modest amount of ballyhoo.
Not such a large room, but definitely well appointed.  The floors are lined in
smooth, black marble, plush crimson rugs thrown around here and there to keep
the feet warm.  One wall is inlayed with a large, flatscreen TV, all of the
gaming consoles - past and present - are on display below it and ready to be
played.  A vintage jukebox sits against another wall, full of everything from 
Sinatra to Gaga.  Somehow, it always seems to offer the exact song the player
wants to hear.  On the far wall, the painting, "The Singing Butler" is displayed
quite grandly.  But, clearly, the focal point of the room is the massive,
full-size H.R. Giger Alien statue that rests just beside the jukebox, and is
lit up like small town America on the fourth of July.

You have been transported to a room on a UFO!! The whole room is white with
no furniture that you can see but for one large examining table in the middle
of the room. A little man walks in and with a motion of his hands, equipement
starts sliding out of the walls. Something sharp, something definately wicked
looking, lands in his hands as he walks toward you and the table.
