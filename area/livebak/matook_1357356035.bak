============================================
In Memory of Fluzel (Founder of Matook):
 
Anger rules the world
Anger feeds the starving soul.
Run and hide when anger hits
for anger rules the world.
 
Love life when all is calm
run and hide when not
for fear resides in those that think
that anger is not hot.
 
Love is blind to those you see
who wish to live in harmony.
One cannot love with anger and hate
for fear will always rule one's fate.
 
Fear is a word best described
as a disease one has caught up inside.
Run young child run born free
for fear is not your destiny.
 
Health and happiness are your sword
for love and laughter are your goal.
To live a life full of peace
One must love or see it decrease.
============================================
The Church of Matook was built with help
from too many to name, yet they deserve
great credit for their faithful service
on the path to Matook.  Many thanks to
all the believers in Matook.
 
May Matook Protect you.

Ruiner's Cathedral Condominium~
You relax in the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.
The black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.
Through the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.
Large black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that
serve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and
grey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black
leather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.
The walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings 
are over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle.
