Creating forge is pretty simple.
 
You need at least 4 different items created before your forge can be coded 
to work. 
{R*{x Actual forge
{R*{x At least two item parts that are placed into forge when created 
{R*{x And end product of forge.
 
When you have all these items created. Write a note to coders explaining 
your need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe 
can be coded.  
After you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into 
value0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one 
forge).
 
For more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into 
recipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. 
For example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in 
forge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But 
if anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, 
they just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.

    Certain items in the game can be placed in a "forge container"
and "forged" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that
an Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.
There is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.

There may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in

is checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills

Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his

so if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods
leaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this

   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal
rage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian
has two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian

be as high as 30%.

0 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~
Barbarian~
1360083666 8 Uniball

The barbarian's rage is a unique type of {cberserk{x attack.  It kicks in
automatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better
the chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian
is in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.
Because the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some
regard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.

{x
{CQ{x. What are the benefits of taking a kit?
{YA{x. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you
have a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit
you have.
{x
{CQ{x. What is the downside?
{YA{x. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.

{CQ{x. Which kits are available for my class?

{CQ{x. Can I take multiple kits?
{YA{x. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change
kits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For
example, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit
you will loose your old enchanting abilities.
{x
{CQ{x. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?
{YA{x. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.
{x
{CQ{x. How do I accept a kit?
{YA{x. Type 'kit take <name>'
{x
{CQ{x. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!
{YA{x. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.

Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.

users of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs
in the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.

	The four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when
cast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the

But the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The

Mutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that

races.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,
size, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes
change as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain
that knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no 
control over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP
depending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority
of their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not

strayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness
outside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from
humans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly
exact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability
to sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),
but they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly
as a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark

The MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.
 
Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

Cleric Default~
1360102990 8 Uniball
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  
Most of their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, 
with their few combat spells being far less powerful than those 
of mages. However, clerics are the best class by far at healing 
magics, and they posess an impressive area of protective magics, 
as well as fair combat prowess.
~
0 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~
'Thief Default'~
1360078924 8 Uniball
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.
~
0 WARRIOR~
Warrior Default~
1360079486 8 Uniball
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

~
0 BACKSTAB~
Thief Rogue~
1360078595 8 Slodhian
Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
~
-1 BASH~
None~
0 1 none
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 THROW THROWS~
None~
0 1 none
The throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's
victim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.
~
-1 KAILINDO~
None~
0 1 none
An anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.
~
-1 BERSERK~
None~
0 1 none
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
None~
0 1 none
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
-1 GAROTTE~
None~
0 1 none
This skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using
a wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are
generally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the
victim.  This skill is available only to assassins.
~
-1 DISARM~
None~
0 1 none
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
0 DODGE~
Parry 'Shield Block'~
1358631492 8 Uniball
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target. All classes may learn this skill.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
None~
0 1 none
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 ENVENOM~
None~
0 1 none
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
0 'HAND TO HAND'~
Weapon~
1358632236 8 Uniball
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
~
-1 KICK~
None~
0 1 none
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
0 PARRY~
Weapon Parry 'Shield Block'~
1358631542 8 Uniball
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~
None~
0 1 none
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~
None~
0 1 none
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
0 'SECOND ATTACK'~
'Third Attack' Damage~
0 1 none
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~
0 'THIRD ATTACK'~
'Second Attack' Damage~
0 1 none
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~
None~
0 1 none
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~
None~
0 1 none
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.

-1 LORE~
None~
0 1 none
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
None~
0 1 none
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
-1 PEEK~
None~
0 1 none
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
None~
0 1 none
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 COMMUNION~
None~
0 1 none
A skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert
his or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The
use of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to
cast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have
enough hit points to survive the hit.
~
-1 MEDITATION~
None~
0 1 none
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.

None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
        cast 'detect evil'

None~
0 1 none

Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to

~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
0 'PORTAL'~
Transportation~
1358565339 8 Slodhian
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
-1 'SHARPEN'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: sharpen 'weapon'

Sharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows 
them to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.
Sharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.

                    WARNING WARNING WARNING

There is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will 
DESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons
and causing anguish. 
~
0 'NEXUS'~
Transportation~
1358565384 8 Slodhian
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
-1 FRENZY~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~
-1 CALM~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
-1 HASTE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
-1 FEAST~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'feast' <target>

The 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of
the belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be
it living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given
creature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,
he or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.
~
-1 FAMINE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'famine' <target>

The 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains
sustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and 
food, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the
'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be
hungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always
succeed.
~
-1 SLOW~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
0 PLAGUE~
None~
1358495178 8 Uniball
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading
plague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you
do not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may
find yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
        cast 'protection good' <target>
	cast 'protection neutral' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at 
the same time.

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 FARSIGHT~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'farsight'
  cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
0 'MASS HEALING'~
None~
1358502567 8 Uniball
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
0 'FLOATING DISC'~
Creation~
1358564924 8 Slodhian
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
-1 FIREPROOF~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: alias
  alias <word>
  alias <word> <substitution>
  unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.

Syntax: cast 'traveler fog'

This spell brings into being a cloud of greenish vapours.  The fog is
a magical creation of the sphere of Air, and by stepping into it, a

-1 'RUST ARMOR'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'rust armor' <victim>

This is an offensive spell that is cast upon your enemy (duh).  The
spell's effect is to attempt to oxidize any armor that the victim is
wearing.  Some materials do not rust easily, and enchanted armor is
especially difficult to affect.  However, rusted armor looses all non-
magical armor class value, making it worth less (but not necessarily
worthless).
~
-1 'RUST WEAPON'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'rust weapon' <victim>

An offensive earth spell, 'Rust Weapon' attempts to rust whatever 
weapon the victim is wielding.  This spell is powerful, and yet difficult

0 NECROMANCER~
None~
0 1 none
The necromancer is the ultimate evil spell caster.  They are completely
incharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one
new spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).
Necromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic 
spells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,
they suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.
Because they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop
when these spells are cast.
Necromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells
very well.

0 Wraithform~
Unwraith 'Kit List' ~
1358576334 8 Uniball
syntax: c 'wraithform'
 
By casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.
Because they are made of mist, they are limited in their actions.  
Likewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in
wraithform.
 
The necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell
has worn out, or they will die.  All of thier material possessions will
cross into the Netherworld.
 
Entering into and leaving wraithform does require quite some time to 
accomplish.

and all of thier belongings will pass into the Netherworld.

1 MUTINY~
None~
0 1 none
If you are unsatisfied with the current leadership of your clan you may mutiny
and try to take over the clan for yourself.  Depending on your clan there are
several ways to go about this.

{CHonor{x {YZealot{x {MPosse{x 

State your intention to mutiny in a cnote to your clan and to immortal
declaring your intention to mutiny and 3 supporters, you or one of your
supporters must have attained a rank of at least /3.  At this point all
recruiters will be demoted and each player in the clan may vote for the
person whom they think should lead the clan.  Votes will be tallied by
an Immortal and the voting shall last for 1 week.  The loser(s) of the vote
will be ranked /0 and all of their valuables will be handed over to the  
victor.  The future of the loser in the clan is left in the hands of the
victor.

{gWarlock{x

State your intention to mutiny the leader of your robe in a cnote to your
clan and to immortal declaring your intention to mutiny and 3
supporters, you or one of your supports must have attained a rank of at
least /3.  At this point all recruiters will be demoted and each player in
the clan may vote for the person whom they think should lead the robe.
Votes will be tallied by immortal and the voting shall last for 1 week.
The loser of the vote will be ranked /0 and all of their valuables will
be handed over to the victor.  The future of the loser in the clan is left
in the hands of the victor.

{RDemise{x

State your intention to mutiny in a cnote to Demise and to immortal
declaring your intention to mutiny and 3 supporters, you or one of
your supports must have attained a rank of at least /3.  At this point
a duel will be scheduled by the immortals between the mutineer and
one of the /5's to be decided upon by the current leadership or if the
mutineer chooses to only replace one of the leaders of demise they
may declare which /5 they wish will duel. .  Should one of the parties
fail to respond to the immortals or miss the duel, they will lose by
default.   The loser(s) of the vote will be ranked /0 and all of their
valuables will be handed over to the victor.  The future of the loser
in the clan is left in the hands of the victor.

Notes about all clan mutinies:

* Attempting a mutiny is considered treasonous, should be caught
attempting to gather support for a mutiny there is high probability
that you will be outcast.

* Voting more than once or supporting with different characters of 
yours in a mutiny is considered multiplaying and will result in 
additional punishments as well as having your votes disqualified.

* Anything not covered in this help file may be decided at the
immortals digression.

CLAN MUTINY POLICIES:

AVARICE:

To mutiny the leader of Avarice, it is very simple. All you
need to do, is:
1.  Announce intent with the support of 1 /4.  (If you are
a /4, thats fine, support of any other member is acceptable.
2.  A vote will be held, winner takes all.  If there is a tie
then it is settled by dual.
3.  Anyone guilded within 2 weeks of the Mutiny is NOT permitted
a vote.
4.  The loser will be required to leave all EQ behind.  This is
so the leader (Whom may be holding clan funds) doesn't make
it out the door and screw the clan.  It will be up to the
winner to return any other gear.  (which would follow charter)

DEMISE:

To mutiny in Demise, you need to have five supporters who
are different characters, and you must organize the mutiny
in seret, posting the mutiny note to Demise and the immortals
once the supporters, one of which must be a /4, have been
arranged.  Otherwise, the current leader is entitled to 
outcast you at any time prior to the public posting.
In addition, you yourself must have been in Demise for
a period of two months, not necessairly consecutive months
provided you didn't join any other clan if you were a loner
at some point.  Once these requirements have been satisified,
a duel will take place in which each side may declare a champion
to fight in their place.  The winning side becomes the leader.

HONOR:

Any Mutineer must have attained the rank of /2 or above and have at
least 5 supporters, those of rank /3 only require 4 supporers, and
those of rank /4 only require 3 supporters. He must then post a note 
declaring the mutiny that includes character info, mutiny reasons and 
the names of his supporters.  If this is done, and the supporters are 
verified,1 week of voting will commence. An immortal will count the 
votes. No recruiting will take place during the week of voting.  Voting 
with alts will disqualify a person's votes.  The mutineer and /5's may 
not vote.The loser of the mutiny will be ranked /1 and will hand over all
valuables to the victor.

POSSE:

If you wish to challenge for leadership, it works as a simple
majority vote. In order to be elligible you must first gain 
support from at least 3 other posse members.Once you have 
necessary support, the election begins. Majority wins.
The parties involved (being the Leader challenged and the 
challenger) can not vote.

WARLOCK:

Majority Vote was method used in past, so as it stands that 
is the policy. An Imm would be asked to tally votes.
Mutineer would post cnote to 'Warlock Immortal' declaring mutiny
and giving name of IMM to post your vote to.
(so votes can be anonymous) 7 days from post date, vote is tallied, 
winner is /5 looser is outcast.

ZEALOT:

To mutiny in Zealot, the mutineer must be a rank /4, and have the
support of at least 5 other members who have been ranked above /0
and who have been in the clan for at least one month's time.
The Anointed then has the choice to either settle the dispute
via a duel, or a clan vote.
If a duel is called for, an IMM will supervise on a preset date which
will be at least one week after the mutiny was called. The duel will
be to the death, with no charmies. Cheaters will lose automatically.
If the Anointed does not wish to duel, he or she may call for a
clan vote, which shall last for a period of one week. During that
time, all /4s shall be reduced to /0 until the vote is decided, or
one of the contesting parties withdraws.

The loser of either contest will be at the winner's discretion.

The Infamous Prefresh

Q. What is it?
A. The prefresh is short for "player refresh".  It is a process by which all
current player files (the file that contains the data about your character in
fixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.

Q. How often will we do this?
A. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.

Q. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?
A. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also
run a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through
to make sure there are no bugs.

Q. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?
A. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your
character is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a
sort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh
and an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just
in case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure
a copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of
prefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.

Q. What are my options?
A. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character
is set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your
alignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,
you are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default
back to their original values.  When you type "score", you'll see that you
have an item called "debit levels".  You may use these at any time to level.

Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  For your sledding convenience, a
money changer can be found in northern Midgaard on clan road, he charges a
5% fee for his services.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 5000 gold pieces

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are an immortal (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
-1 AFK~
None~
0 1 none
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

Neither being AFK nor link-dead will offer you protection against npcs or
against other players; however, it is considered in poor taste.  Those who
misuse the AFK flag or link-dead flag will likely receive player retribution

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (IMMs want 
you to have your gold).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse, unless that person who died was clanned, in which case
their corpse is free for the looting by another clanned player.

Camping the corpse of a non-clanner and waiting for it to rot is forbidden.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Race Class~
0 1 none
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:
    
    killing a player or creature
    being part of a group that kills a monster
    participating in a quest that gives experience as a reward
    global experience rewards

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying even when under the effects of withstand death

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

While being in a group decreases the experience you receive, including grouping
with pets and other charmed creatures, the total experience rewarded to your
group per monster is increased by 20% when grouped with other players.

0 TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this sled average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.  This can
cause items, such as the satchel in MUD school, to not respawn.

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases and can be viewed by use of
the spell command.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name. Using aliases can make longer word spells
easier to cast.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects. For a more
useful comparison, use the lore ability of Identify Object

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you. It is much more difficult to flee from multiple attackers
than from a single attacker.(You can also RECALL, but this is less
likely to work, and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can

The notes on MHS replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other sleds.  There are several types of notes including In-Character notes 
(inotes), Out-of-Character Notes(onotes), Bug Notes (bug), Quest Notes (qnotes) 
and God Notes (gnote). 
The following options are usable (in this case, an inote is used as an example,
for other types of notes, simply replace inote with the appropriate type of
note):

reading notes:
inote list    : show all inotes (unread notes are marked with an N)
inote read    : either by number, or read next to read unread inotes
inote remove  : removes an inote that you wrote or are the target of
inote catchup : markes all inotes as read
spool         : Catches up all notes of all types
unread        : Lists notes that have not been read by this character

writing new notes:
inote to      : sets the to line (name, clanname, 'clans', immortal, or all)
inote subject : sets the subject for a new inote
inote +       : adds a line to a new inote (i.e. inote + hi guys!)
inote ++      : adds two lines to a new inote (i.e. a new paragraph)
inote -       : remove a line from an inote in progress (Text will do a replace)
inote >       : appends text to the current line (i.e. inote > more writing)
inote clear   : erase an inote in progress
inote show    : shows the inote you are working on
inote post    : posts a new inote. This MUST be done to post an inote.
inote send    : same as inote post

See also: 'help text edit'

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
inote read to scroll through them one at a time.

Four other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and 
penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is
restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.

Unlike other notes, you do not need to fill out the to field when writing
bug notes.

Be aware that all notes, even those sent to individual players, can and
will be read by the immortal staff.

Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

Be careful!  Type carefully when buyign things.  If the shopkeeper thinks
you are trying to cheat him out of his wares by feeding him weird information,
he'll confiscate all your money.  Know the 'buy' command inside and out.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight if set to autoassist.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

Groups can be broken by having group members follow themselves, or the 
leader of the group can use the nofollow command.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within eight levels of
your own.

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other sled that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this sled.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

0 RECALL /~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your deity for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

RECALL stops working as an instant ability after level 10 or upon joining a
clan, at that point players must pray for recall or cast the spell "word of
recall".

{WAfter level 10{x RECALL may be used by any clan once they have placed their
hall.  It will warp you to the room immediately outside of your hall entry.
There is a significant delay before the warp occurs, as well as delay
afterwards, so be careful when using this as you will be vulnerable to enemy
attack during both delays.  If you have no hall, you will go to recall.

This RECALL will function even in areas you can't normally recall out of, or if
you are cursed.  However the time it takes to activate will increase based on
how difficult it is to transport away.  Recent combat with players will also
increase the time it takes.

0 SPLIT~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30   --> split 30 silver
split 20 50  --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10  --> split 10 gold

AUTOSPLIT will automate this procedure for you and is on by default.
~
0 SNATCH~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax:  snatch <floating object> <character>

Snatch attempts to steal a character or mobs floating object.
Only those in the clan system may steal from other characters.
If you are caught snatching from another character, you will receive the
THIEF flag.  If you are caught snatching from a mob, they will attack
you.

Snatch works better for players with higher dexterity, and it is harder
to snatch items from a player with high dexterity.
~
0 STEAL~

Syntax: steal coins <character>
Syntax: steal <object> <character>

Steal attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character or mob.
Objects must be in the inventory of the target, you are not able to
steal items they are wearing (no one is that good).  Only those in the
clan system may steal from other characters.
If you are caught stealing from another character, you will receive the
THIEF flag.  If you are caught stealing from a mob, they will attack
you.

Steal works better for those with higher dexterity.  It is harder to

PRACTICE with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell. 
Your learning percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%
You must be at a guild master to practice and can only practice skills

PRACTICE -new will display your skills/spells less then 75%.

PRACTICE -skills will display only your skills.

PRACTICE -spells will display only your spells.

PRACTICE -old with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up
to your old skill % prior to Pfresh for a cost of 1 practice. If you are
not a pfresh character then this option is not useable.

PRACTICE -skip with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up
regularly, ignoring any old skill % prior to Pfresh.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you

0 1 none
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con cha hp mana moves prac>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
moves, mana, hp, or practices by 10.  You receive one train per level.
For each time you train practices, you will be able to "gain retrain"
once.  {WNOTE:{x "gain retrain" costs twice as many practices as you
get from "train practice", balance your needs carefully.

The best attributes to train first are CON and STR.  These will give
you more hit points each level.  WIS is also valuable as it can earn
you more practices per level.

halved too.  These are known as half trains.  Along with your trains,
your retrains turn into half retrains because they were also trains you
gained before remorting.  When training, half trains are used up before
trains because they were earned first.

It takes one half training session to improve an attribute, or to
increase moves, mana or hp by 5.  Practices are increased by 10.  For
each time you train practices, you will be able to "gain retrain" once.

0 RETRAIN~
None~
0 1 none
You receive one retrain whenever you train practice.  You can turn a
retrain back into a train for 20 practices by using "gain retrain"
anywhere you can use "gain".

{WREMORTS ONLY:{x If you remort, any retrains you have stored will
become half retrains, and "gain retrain" will buy them back first.
Since you do not lose practices when you remort, the price is the same
for gaining a half retrain as for gaining a retrain.

57 FUCK~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: fuck <character>

FUCK is used on the more annoying players, and those that are spamming
incessently.  The technicalities of the command will be spared, but it
does basically what it says.  It is similar to the DISCONNECT command,
but has it's special twist.  Use this command to bide time or annoy an
annoying user.  It should, in most cases, take them a bit to relog.
~
59 ADVANCE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
60 TRUST~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
57 DNS UNDNS~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: dns <IP or IP block>
        undns <listed IP or IP block>
  dns

DNS <IP or IP block> adds to a linked list of strings that are
checked against the IP of an incoming socket to see if it should
be looked up for an IP to name record (PTR).  The check uses a
str_prefix() comparison so partial blocks will work as well
as full dotted quad IP's.

Running the command with no arguments shows the current list.
The 'undns' command removes the exact matching string from the list.

Typos containing non-IP strings simply get skipped since they never
match an IP or block.  But, typos should be removed.
~
58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: allow   <site>
  ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
  ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~
59 EQLIST~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: eqlist <all|armor|weapons>

EQLIST generates a flat file in /mud/moosehead/src called eqlist.eql (all),
armor.eql (armor) or weapons.eql (weapons). The file contains a listing of
the equipment in a designated way for a PERL Script to parse into an online
equipment list.
~
59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: reboot
  shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

Never, ever, shutdown the sled without consulting the owner.
~
56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: wizlock
  newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MooseHead Sled. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the owner and
Creators.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
59 DENY~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by having a 59 pload the character, so
freeze is usually preferred.
~
57 DISCONNECT~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
57 FREEZE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
55 CTALK~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: ctalk <clan> <message>

Ctalk lets an immortal speak on a clan channel without the need
to guild themself into and out of the clan in question.  It also
automatically turns on LISTEN if it's off, so that you will hear
any responses to your message.

SEE ALSO:  listen
~
55 LISTEN~
None~
0 1 none
syntax: listen

Listen is a toggle that allows you to turn on or off the ability

a clan channel is also printed out to you, along with a header
denoting the clan channel it came across.
~
53 FORCE~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
57 FUCK~
None~
0 1 none
'Fuck' is a command that starts a Zmodem download on that players side,
thereby dumping him/her, and basically 'fuck'ing up their connection and
terminal.  Sometimes, it will have devestating affects, sometimes, it will
only be as good as a 'disconnect'.
~
56 SOCKETS~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: sockets
  sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
58 HOSTMASK~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: hostmask <password> <string> <character>

NOTE:  THE CHARACTER YOU ARE HOSTMASKING *MUST* BE CONNECTED!!!
       If you try to hostmask a ploaded or link dead character
       you WILL crash the game.

Hostmask allows you to mask the ip address of the socket you are coming 
in on.  This can be usefull if you do not want others to know who your 
morts are.

~
56 LOAD~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
  load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)

  set obj   <object> <field> <value>
  set room  <number> <field> <value>
  set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
  set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~
55 STRING~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
  string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
When doing a restring here are some rules:
*You may not restring an item so that it's name, short, or long
match an existing item in the game.  Always vnum what they are
asking for to see if it is an item in the game.

Example of Bad Restrings:
an assassin's quiver restrung to a pair of black dragon scale leggings
a portable hole restrung to a gnomish sword

Example of Ok Restrings:
an assassin's quiver restrung to a dragon scale pouch
a portable hole restrung to a vat of gumbo

The assassin's quiver is a container, a dragon scale pouch leads 
people to believe it is a container.  Hence, that would be an ok
restring.
*All words in the name must appear in the short and long descriptions

Generally, morts will say "i want this to be called joes big gun"
It is up to you to make sure that "joes big gun" appears in the short
and long description.

Example of a Bad Restring:
Original Item:   rangers backpack
New Name:        my secret hidey hole bag
New Short:       rangers backpack
New Long:        A rangers backpack lies here.

The above would be a very very very bad restring.  

Example of a Good Restring:
Origional Item:       rangers backpack
what the mort wants:  my secret hidey hole bag
New Name:             my secret hidey hole bag his
New Short:            his secret hidey hole bag
New Long:             My secret hidey hole bag lies here.

The short is different so it looks "cool" when they take things
out of the bag they say.  So, it is up to you to make sure that
"my" appears in the name of the item.
----------
*Always get permission before putting other people's names in 
a restring.

If you have any questions about this, please ask an admin

55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: nochannel <character>
  noemote   <character>
  noshout   <character>
  notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
57 PARDON~
None~
0 1 none

in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.

Restore nonclan is the same as restore all except it will not restore clanners.
Restore all has been changed to not restore clanners that are currently in a
pfight status.
~
57 SLAY~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: slay <character>

None~
1358632871 8 Uniball
Syntax: transfer <character>
  transfer all
  transfer <character> <location>
  transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
54 AT~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: echo  <message>
  gecho <message>
  pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.  Zecho is an echo throughout the entire current area.

0 1 none
Syntax: holylight
  wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
52 INCOGNITO~
None~
0 1 none
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes

you regardless of location.
~
52 MEMORY~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your sled.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
56 VNUM~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: vnum <name>
  vnum <obj or mob> <name>
  vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~
53 STAT~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: stat <name>
  stat mob  <name>
  stat obj  <name>
  stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.

your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)

~
55 LOG SNOOP~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: log   <character>
  log   all
  snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to Rusty.  

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Rusty.


Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one

None~
0 1 none
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <character>
Spell Type: Dispel
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.

the spell in a mage lab and if they have taken the ENCHANTER kit.
~
-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
None~
0 1 none
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2

natural race to other races. Exchanging racial natural affects, resistances, 
immunities, vulnerabilities,size and statistic abilities with the new race.

the shift they may eventually die. Shifting also removes all the Shapeshifter's 
equipment prior to shifting and returning. The Shapeshifter's influx of magical
ability also causes them to be slightly more vulnerable to spells.

A Shapeshifter of low-level can shift into races of the same size without 
difficulty yet have a slim chance of shifting into other sizes. As a 
Shapeshifter progresses he/she will find it easier to make larger shifts in

~
0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Dodge Parry~
1358631999 8 Uniball
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a

defend themselves well with a shield. Beware, flails ignore shield
blocking attempts, and whips have an easier time getting around them.

A Roman Gladiator stands at the center of the Great Colosseum looking
up at the Emperor, awaiting his decision. With the power of life or
death, the Emperor's thumb is outstretched, and the monarch's expression
unforgiving. He appears poised to signal the Gladiator to kill his
defeated opponent.

Gladiator Combat is a pkilling event in which opponents attempt to be
the last man standing in the Arena. Depending on the options chosen by
the holder of the event, nonclanners may be able to participate with
clanners.

area. Here you can prepare and wait the for the battle to begin. When the
battle starts you will be restored and transported randomly into the Arena.
Hunt down your opponents and kill them for victory.

Losing link or quiting in the Arena will remove you from the event and

0 RESTRING RESTRINGS~
Color~
1358682204 8 Uniball
A restring is a service offered by Immortals to players who ask politely.
A restring allows you to rename an item in your possession.
Before you get a restring there are a few things you need to make sure you
have first:
 
{Wi) {x1 shard for a standard restring, 2 shards for a restring with color,
{ {x      or a restring certificate of some sort
{Wii) {xThe item you wish to restring
{Wiii) {xThe short and long description of the item you wish to have restrung
 
Once you have all of these things you can ask an immortal ({rlevel 55+{x) if they
would be willing to do one for you.  You will be asked to provide the short
description and long description (and in some cases the keywords, or name)
of the item. The keywords you choose must be in both the long and short
descriptions you provide.
 
A short description is what you see when and item is in a shop, being worn,
or in your inventory.  A long description is what you see when an item is
either examined/looked at, or on the ground.
 
{W1) {x   The keywords you choose *MUST* exist in both the long and short
{ {x            descriptions.  If there is more than one key, you may have one
{ {x            key in the short description, and a different one in the long
{ {x            description, so long both long and short have a keyword in them.
 
{W2) {x   Several different objects may not be restrung with the exact same
{ {x            name.  This means at the same time or over time.  Objects found to
{ {x            be intentionally restrung with duplicate names will be confiscated.
 
{W3) {x   You may not include the name of another character in the restring
{ {x            of an item without the express consent of that character.
 
{W4) {x   Containers must be restrung to something that resembles a container
{ {x            in some fashion.  Be creative, but no restringing "a bag" into "a
{ {x            shoe".
 
{W5) {x   There is no discount for multiple restrings at the same time.  The
{ {x            pricing listed above is very reasonable.
 
When an Immortal does a restring for you it is polite to pay attention to
what they are saying and it is always a good idea to know what you want
before you ask for a restring (unless you have prior arrangements with that
immortal), to avoid causing an Immortal unnecessary trouble.  If you follow
the directions given above your experiences with receiving restrings should
be wonderful, memorable experiences.

0 'FAST REGEN'~

Any room that has at least +100% additional regen for hit points or mana can
activate fast regen for those sleeping in it.  To receive fast regen, you must
not be hungry, thirsty, poisoned, plagued, hasted, or slowed.

The enhanced regen matches the bonuses of the room, so if you are in a room
that only boosts your hit regen you will only receive fast regen for hit points
and not mana.  However, move regen will be enhanced by 50% of the value of the
others.

{YThe medium ability is not implemented yet, it will be coming later.{x
Mediums have an ability that they may activate once an hour to initiate fast
hit and mana regen on a target.  It will remain active until the target is at
full stats or takes action.

Note: If a player has their combat timer active, they do not gain fast regen
from the room, though the medium's ability can still be used on them.

0 ESTABLISH~

Syntax: establish <clan name>
Syntax: establish type <type> <option>
Syntax: establish color <color code letter> (set)

Establish a clan:
To create a clan, you must establish it in the eyes of the gods.  This is done
by being in the Priest of All Gods' room and requesting that your clan be
established.  If the name of your clan is acceptable, you will be granted
leadership of the forming clan and must complete your initiation trial.

{YNote that this process is bypassed currently: You can establish in any room
you can place a clan hall in, and you do not have to complete initiation.{x

{WThe rules for placing a hall{x: The room can't have any mob or item spawn in it,
it can't have level or class restrictions, it can't be a clan room.  All the
exits leading out need to lead back (If you go north, south needs to lead back
in).  It can't be no_recall.  Basically, an empty room with nothing special
about it.  There may be a few locations that are inappropriate, if you find
one you will be asked to move but will not be punished for it.

The initiation trial for forming a clan has the following requirements:
1) While doing a clan initiation, you keep no merit that you earn.  It converts
  to tribute for your clan immediately.
2) You must gain 1,000 points of tribute to complete initiation.
3) You have three days to complete your initiation or it ends in failure.

If you fail an initiation the clan you are attempting to form disbands, and you
must restart the process if you want to try again.

While the clan is forming, all leadership commands related to inviting new
members are available to you.  Sanctioning and permission commands are not.

Upon successful completion of your trial, your clan will form as a gang - A
clan that has not established a type.  It will begin with no hall.

Establish a clan type:
If you have no type it is free to select one.  If you already have a type (So
you're changing it) you will have to complete an initiation.  <option> is only
used if the type of clan you are selecting has a subtype with it.

You may not create a hall until you have selected a type.

{YNote that for now changing your type is free and does not require initiation.
Later it will likely require both initiation and a small tribute payment.{x

Establish a clan color:
You can set the color your clan name will show up in the who list.  To do this
you simply enter the color code and then set.  If you want to see what the name
will look like colored, just don't set it initially.

To keep a clan going there must be a certain level of activity.  The
requirements to remain active are reduced for gangs (Gangs are clans that have
not established a type).  A clan that does not have enough activity is subject
to deactivation.

A gang is considered active if:
At least 200 tribute points are donated per week.

A clan is considered active if:
At least 500 tribute points are donated per week.

{YInactivity is not implemented yet.{x

If a clan is inactive for two weeks, their type will be removed and their hall
entry will be unlinked with no refund provided.  Clan members that had logged
out in the hall will log on at the altar respawn.  To reactivate, a leader
needs to declare a type and link the hall back into the world.  This will
require an initiation, because the clan previously had a type.

If a gang is inactive for two weeks, their status will be downgraded to
inactive and all members will be marked accordingly.  Their name will become
available to anyone who wants to establish a clan.  If it was a downgraded
clan, their hall will be entirely removed and they will have the costs refunded
at the standard rates.  To reactivate, a leader must use the establish command
(Because their name may have changed) and initiation must be completed.

All stored tribute, planned objects, and the member list for the clan is
preserved during this process, even if the clan becomes deactivated.

Note if a clan completely deactivates, it will require two sets of initiation
(Once for the name, once for the type) to reactivate.

Welcome to the new clan system!

For information on what it means to be a clanner, check help clanlife

Clans are now formed by players, including construction of their halls.  The
old clans no longer can be recruited into, but will continue to exist to give a
haven for those who are not yet ready to move into a new home.  To form a new
clan, the establish command must be used.  Once you are part of a new clan or a
loner in the new system, you'll be able to earn merit.

To compensate for the work put into current halls, starter tribute is awarded
to you when you switch from the new system to the old system.  Please read the
help file on it for details on how it works.

The old clan names are reserved, people may not create clans with them.  This
also includes popular traditional names such as Avarice, Circle, Riders, and a
few others.  These names have been restricted due to the possibilities for
arguments over who deserves to lead a clan with them -- everyone must find
their own way, instead.

For those interested in just diving in and poking around with hall building
after establishing a clan, 'help hedit example' will give you a quick guide on
the syntax to create and place your first hall objects.

0 'CLAN GUARDIAN'~
None~
0 1 none
Syntax: c guardian
Syntax: c guardian <command>

Clans of Law with the basic clan skill may summon a guardian to assist them
against their foes.  To summon the guardian, the member must be in their hall
and have enough hit points, mana, and movement available.  Clan guardians will
never initiate an attack on a target that is not an enemy of their clan's Law.
Guardians share vision with their master, if the master can't see a target the
guardian can't see it either.

After summoning the guardian, the owner may issue the following commands:

c guardian assist - The guardian will only attack the same enemy as its master.
c guardian attack - The guardian will attack any enemy it sees.
c guardian passive - The guardian will never initiate an attack.
c guardian hold - The guardian will stay in the room its in.
c guardian follow - The guardian will resume following its master.
c guardian home - The guardian will transport to the room outside its hall.

Requirements:
You must all follow the same deity (Entry into the clan will enforce it).
You may not group with those who don't follow your deity.
You may not normally attack those who follow your deity.

Bonuses:
The Almighty especially favors clans of faith, and will grant additional
  prayers not available to those outside the clan.  See 'help almighty' for
  details.
pray knowledge and pray condemn become available to allow you to gain insight
  into an enemy's deity, and to declare them a heretic (Allowing you to attack
  even one who follows your deity.)  Note that players will be allowed the
  option of being a "secret follower" -- in that case, pray knowledge will not
  identify them as following your deity, but you will also not be prevented
  from attacking them even if they do follow your clan's deity.

Up to 10% of donated merit from player kills and 5% from NPC kills may be
  matched by sac points for one day after donation.  One sac point is worth 1
  merit, so when you donate 10,000 merit from player kills you may donate 1,000
  sac points for 1,000 more.  The person donating the sac points does not have
  to be the person who donated the merit.

Bonuses:
Up to 10% of donated merit from player kills and 5% from NPC kills may be

There are two types of clan skills: Default and Purchased.

Default: Default clan skills are based on your selection of clan type, and
  require that you have a basic hall to use.  Nobody currently has enough
  tribute for enhanced versions of the default skills, but they all may be
  upgraded twice by acquiring enough tribute.

Purchased: Purchased clan skills require an advanced hall in order to gain, and
  an additional cost in merit to obtain.  They may be selected from a defined
  list of available skills, or a new one may become available upon request --
  but be warned, any skill you design will also be made available to other
  clans.  Not all skills are available to all types of clan.

There will eventually be a list of purchasable skills and the clan types that
can use each.

Clan leaders have responsibility not only for guiding their clans, but their
actions have added weight.

Leader abilities:
guild <character> <rank>: Invite someone to join your clan, with a starting
  rank of <rank>.  It costs 1,000 tribute to guild an outcast.

guild <character> <rank> offline: The same as invite, but it will invite a
  player who is not currently online.  Note that this does not verify the name
  of an offline player, so if you do not get the name exactly right the cost
  will be wasted.  Offline invitations expire after a week if they are not
  accepted.

rank <character>: Sets the character's rank to the desired value.  You may not
  lower another leader's rank.

sanction <character>: Applies sanctions to the target.  You may not sanction
  another leader.  See 'help sanction' for details.

outcast <character>: Kicks someone out of the clan.  You may not outcast
  another leader.

alliance <clan> <duration> <payment> <bribe>: Offer to ally with target clan
  for duration days.  Payment is who will be paying for this alliance, see
  'help alliance' for details on duration, costs and options.

Hall Building: Leaders may edit their halls.  See 'help hall building' for
  details.

{YPlease note that tribute risks and rewards are not implemented yet.{x
Tribute Risks and Rewards:
Clan leaders gain some special bonuses involving tribute, for normal gains and
for pk risks.

Whenever a leader gains merit for a kill, 5% bonus is added to the clan's
tribute storage immediately.  This applies to both straight kills and kill
offerings.  It does not apply to tribute transferred from a slain enemy.

When a leader dies in pk, their clan loses 5 tribute points and the killers
split those points based on looting rules.  If an enemy leader is involved, any
points they steal are multiplied by 5.  So if a leader dies to two enemies, one
that is a leader and one that isn't, and the enemy leader could loot 2 items
then they steal 2 * 5 = 10 points, and the other enemy steals 3, causing a
total value of 13 tribute points to be lost for that leader's death.  This loss
does come straight from the clan's stored tribute, though it can not drive it
negative (Less points would be stolen in that case).

Offering an alliance costs 5 points of tribute immediately.  If the alliance is
accepted, that 5 points is counted towards costs already paid.  If it is not,
those points are lost.  The offer will be valid for 24 hours from the time it
is made, then it will be automatically rejected.

Usage: To form an alliance, one clan leader initiates, then a receiving leader
  accepts.  So if the clan "Prey" wanted to offer an alliance to the clan
  "Hunters" and was willing to bribe them 200 points, their leader could enter:
  ally hunters 7 full 200 and a Hunters leader could then decide to 'ally prey
  accept' or 'ally prey reject' based on if that 200 point bribe was worth a
  week of not hunting them.  If the Hunters accepted, the Prey clan would pay
  an additional 100 points for the week of alliance (300 total, due to the
  bribe).  If the Hunters refuse, the Prey clan would still pay 5 points for
  having made the offer.

Effect: When allied, you may group regardless of normal clan type restrictions.
  You are also prevented from attacking allies.

Costs: 1 day:  16 points of tribute.
       2 days: 30 points of tribute.
       3 days: 44 points of tribute.
       4 days: 58 points of tribute.
       5 days: 72 points of tribute.
       6 days: 86 points of tribute.
       7 days: 100 points of tribute.

If at least one of the clans is type Peace, the cost is 4 points less per day
of the alliance - so it goes from 12 (-4) to 72 (-28) points for 1 to 7 days.

{YPlease note that rebellion is not currently functional.{x

To rebel, you must be in or have recently been in a clan.  The rebellion
process can be done if you and those supporting you have contributed at least
10,000 points of tribute to the clan.  If so, you will form a new clan of the
declared type and take up to 20,000 points of tribute with you from your
original clan.

The initiator will be the leader of the new clan, and is responsible for
ensuring promotions as appropriate to those who come with them.  Rebellion can
be a dangerous process, be sure you trust the leader you are following into it.

Once a rebellion is begun, clan membership changes are locked for its duration.
You have one day from initiation to gather all supporters, who will then come
with you.  If the rebellion fails, you will be outcast if you were not already.
Those supporting you will not be outcast, though the leadership of the clan
will be informed of who had supported you and may do as they wish with that
information.  If your rebellion succeeds, both clans (The old clan and the new
clan) will pay 250 points per rebelling character as an offering for their
outcast tribute.

To outcast yourself, simply enter the command with no argument.

A leader may outcast a member of their clan by entering the victim's name after
the command.  If someone is outcast by their leader, they have an opportunity
to launch or join a rebellion against that clan for up to a week after being
outcast.  See 'help rebel' for details on rebellions.

Outcasts are cursed by the gods, and will find it much more difficult to make
their way in the world.  Fortunately, they can redeem themselves and move back
to being loners or directly into a new clan.

To move from outcast to loner has two options:
1) You earn 5 times your donation points of merit and commit it. Outcasts may
not dedicate merit, so this must be earned without dying to another player.
2) A clan may pay 10 times your donation points of tribute to have you join
directly.

An outcast may participate in a clan initiation, but the clan will have to earn
extra tribute equal to cost 2) per outcast involved in order to successfully
form.

If an outcast becomes a loner or joins an existing clan, they can no longer
rebel against the clan that outcast them, even if it is within a week.

Building your hall is done in two steps.  First, you create the new feature
that you want to add.  You will be told the cost to load this item, and can
review all the descriptions on it to ensure that it is what you want.  When
you decide you are ready and your clan has enough tribute, you can request
that your new feature be added.

Be careful to only load objects you want added into the rooms you want them
in, because while there is a refund when you remove something it is not the
full value.  You can upgrade NPCs that have been placed without having to
remove them.

To build the hall itself, you must be a leader of the clan or have been given
permission by the leaders.  Not all functions of building may be available to
you in your hall.

You may also have the opportunity to build personal rooms.  To have personal
rooms requires that you be a member of a clan (So you have a place to attach
your room to), and costs for the room will come out of your bank account.  {YThe
personal rooms feature is not currently available, but will be enabled in the

0 HEDIT~

syntax: hedit <options>

hedit is short for "hall edit", and is where you access everything related to
hall building.  While editing your hall, you will see the labels for every
object that has been placed in it.

For a quick start example, please see 'help hedit example'

There are three types of objects: Planned, Previewed, and Placed.  When you
edit an object before previewing it, that is a planned object.  When you
preview it, that object becomes previewed.  Then you may place it.  Once it is
previewed, it costs its tribute.  However, removing it restores full tribute.
When you remove a previewed object, it becomes planned again.  You may not
remove a placed object.

{RNote{x: You are responsible for knowing when you will be charged for an action.
  Full details are provided in hedit costs, please review it thoroughly before
  doing work as you will not be refunded for accidental charges.

Here are the commands you may access with hedit:

GENERAL COMMANDS:
hedit - Enter edit mode.  This displays the labels for each object in your
  hall.
hedit check - Tells you if you're in a legal room to place your hall from.
hedit list <type> <planned|placed|all> - List all objects by your filter.
hedit create <type> <label> - Create a planned object with label <label>.  This
  command places you into edit mode.
hedit display <label> - Display the details for an object.  If you are editing
  an object you may leave <label> blank and it will display the currently
  edited object's details.
hedit clone <original> <label> - Create a planned object with label <label>
  that is an exact copy of object with label original.  The original object may
  be planned or placed.
hedit edit <label> - Edit a planned object with label name.  This command
  places you into edit mode.
hedit upgrade <label> <attribute> - Upgrade a placed object in the hall.  Leave
  attribute blank to see current upgradable stats.
hedit delete <label> - Delete an object.  Use this if you are running out of
  allowed objects and want to open some room.  You must be editing an object
  in order to delete it.
hedit swap <old> <new> - Swap a placed or previewed object with a planned
  object.  There will eventually be a fee for this, currently it only swaps
  the text (Name, short, long, description) of the object.  Note that if you
  swap a pit its contents will be dumped on the ground.
hedit rules <start|save|cancel> - Begin editing the rules for your clan.  When
  done, use save to end editing and save the changes or cancel to revert to
  what they were when you started.  Note if you hedit stop or quit the game it
  will automatically save.
hedit charter <start|save|cancel> - Begin editing the charter for your clan.
  When done, use save to end editing and save the changes or cancel to revert
  to what they were when you started.  Note if you hedit stop or quit the game
  it will automatically save.
hedit stop - Exit edit mode and save all changes.  Note: There is no exit
  without saving, all edits are done live.

ITEM/MOB COMMANDS:
hedit preview <label> - Preview a planned mob or item in the room you're in.
hedit place <label> - Place a previewed mob or item in the room you're in.

0 'HEDIT EXAMPLE'~
None~
0 1 none
You have some tribute, you're the clan leader, and you want to start your hall.
Here's some examples (Note that examples will often fill in text for you to
replace as appropriate.  If it has <> it's optional text, if it has () around
it it is a note to you and not part of the command at all):

To begin:
hedit

To begin your first room:
hedit create room <entryhall>
hedit name My clan's entry hall
hedit desc + I am writing my entry hall description as if it were a note.
text > The text shortcut automatically puts text into the description too.
text - I didn't like that last line so I want this one instead.
text ++ All the normal note rules apply.
hedit check (See if I'm in a room I can place my first room)
hedit preview <entryhall (Or room_1 if default first room name)> south

Your first room will form to the south, if it's a legal room and you have
enough tribute available.  Before placing, you can also set up the room's
other attributes by other hedit commands, check the help file 'hedit edit' for
a list of your options.

You can repeat this process for other rooms, items, and mobs.  The difference
for items is that a type is required, and both items and mobs need different
fields filled in.  Note that all fields may be filled in in almost any order.
Only fields requiring a previous one (Such as setting liquid requires the item
type to be set to fountain) can't be done at any time.

Please note the included punctuation on the examples -- in general you should
only include punctuation at the end for the in-room description.

Here is a mob:
hedit create mob <healer>
hedit name mighty healer (Keywords to target it)
hedit short A mighty healer (The short name when people interact with this mob)
hedit long A mighty healer stands here, ready to assist you. (In-room desc)
text + A mighty healer stands before you, looking calmly ahead of himself. He
text > does not seem to care who you are, as long as you are a member of his
text > clan he'll help you out. (text can be used without hedit desc to begin)
(Note that text just set the 'look healer' description)
hedit level 51 (Raises his cost, can be set after placing via hedit upgrade)
hedit preview <healer (Or mob_1, etc.)>

Here is an item:
hedit create item <milkfountain>
hedit name cow milk (Keywords to target it)
hedit short a cow (The short name used when people interact with this item)
hedit long A cow stands here, offering you milk. (The in-room description)
hedit type fountain
hedit liquid milk
hedit preview <milkfountain (Or item_1, etc.)>

Finally, you can do two things to a previewed object: You can place it (Which
locks it in) or you can remove it, fully refunding the tribute it cost.  If
your clan has multiple leaders, the leader that previews an item is not able to
place it -- ensuring at least two of three possible leaders approve of that
tribute being spent.  You may not remove the first room you have placed for
your hall, a method to update its text will be added in the future to allow for
corrections in typos or errors made since it has to be locked in (Previewed but
can't be removed like normal) without getting to see it.

To remove a room, you need to be in an adjacent room and enter its label and
direction: hedit remove <room label> <direction>.  To remove an item or mob,
you just need to be in the room it spawns in and hedit remove <label>.

0 'HEDIT ROOM'~
None~
0 1 none
Note: 'hedit room' is not a valid command, this is the help for the hedit
commands relating to rooms:

hedit place <label> <direction> - Place a planned room linked to the room you

  replace if you want to remove a custom exit while leaving the default exit.
hedit replace <label> - Replace the current room with the room of <label>
  label.  This will charge you the difference between a room refund and a new
  room.

0 'STARTER TRIBUTE'~
None~
0 1 none
When you join a new clan you will receive starter tribute based on your hours
played and position in your previous clan.  Unfortunately, it's impossible
to determine what each individual contributed exactly, so everyone is fairly
well rewarded -- in the case of very rich clans, the long time members will
receive more than members of other clans.  Remember that as time goes on, this
bonus will pale in comparison to the tribute clan members can bring in -- and
new members will never reduce the tribute you have available.  So don't count
it against someone to not have a lot of starter tribute.

Starter tribute is intended to let you get a running start with a new clan, but
it is not intended to set you up to never have to earn tribute again.  For this
reason, when anyone with any amount of starter tribute begins a clan, they
receive a flat 20000 tribute bonus separate from their starter tribute.  If a
player is very newly created, they will not have any starter tribute points.
They will have received a starter tribute credit instead, which entitles them
to the 20000 tribute point bonus if they start a clan, but no bonuses past it.
To both provide a suitable reward for older, experienced players while not
allowing people to grab half the mud into their clan and get unreasonable
amounts of tribute, the following scaling has been set up:

The highest starter tribute value is at 100%.  The second highest is at 75%.
The third highest is at 60%.  The fourth highest is at 50%.  This continues on
forever, slowly reducing the bonuses.  This recalculates every time someone
joins or leaves the clan (You can be driven to negative tribute if you spend a
lot and a high-tribute member leaves).

An example: If someone has 2000 starter tribute and begins a clan, they will
have 22000 tribute available.  If a new member joins with 5000 tribute, the
clan will have 26500 tribute -- 20000 + 5000 * 100% + 2000 * 75%.  If the first
player then leaves, the tribute would drop to 25000 as they took their starter
tribute with them (Plus any donated in the meantime -- that does not get taken
away).  As detailed below, this starter tribute transfer out of the clan is
temporary to allow flexibility.

The maximum amount of starting tribute a clan can get is 20000, which leaves
them at double the base amount.  The highest starting tribute a single player
can possibly reach is 10000.  Note that only a few players will qualify for
this amount, but others can compensate by inviting some experienced friends to
their clan for the additive bonus -- reaching the cap is just noticably easier
if you start with a higher value, rewarding your experience with flexibility.

{WNote{x: Starter tribute will not always stay locked to your character, that
is a temporary measure to allow people to more freely switch clans while they
are seeing what the new system involves, and is not expected to last more than
a couple months.  When it is changed, you will not lose your starter tribute
but it will be permanently locked into the clan you are in.  {YThere will be
warning before this happens.{x  At that point, newly created characters (Level
20 and lower joining the clan system) will also stop gaining starter tribute.

0 'MERIT' 'TRIBUTE'~
None~
0 1 none
Tribute to the gods is required to enhance your clan.  It is obtained by
earning merit, then donating the merit.

Killing mobs.  If the mob grants you experience, you can earn merit for
  killing it.  The amount of merit is based on the mob's level, with higher
  enemies giving noticably higher amounts.  Note that having charmies involved
  in the kill will reduce the amount of merit received.  Multiple players
  will split merit based on normal experience rules.

Killing players.  When you kill a player, their currently carried merit is
  completely removed from them and transferred to everyone involved in the kill
  based on the amount of damage each did to the victim.  The killer receives
  the normal kill bonus amount as well, appropriate to the level of the victim.
  The player landing the kill will receive the full merit bonus, a player
  kill does not split.  Charmies will not reduce this bonus.  A player that has
  died recently will not award as much tribute as one that has been alive for a
  longer time.

Stealing from players.  A thief may "steal merit" from an enemy and will then
  attempt a difficult steal to demonstrate to the gods that they are worthy of
  some of the merit their victim has gathered.  A player may only lose up to
  15% of their donation amount per hour to theft.

Completing quests.  There will be automatic quests that will grant some tribute
  upon completion.  {YThese do not exist yet.{x

Once you have earned enough merit, you may donate it.  The amount you donate at
once is based on your level.  If you do not have at least this much, you can
not donate it.  100 merit is worth 1 tribute, which is what clan costs are
measured in.

  Level 5:  100   (1 tribute)
  Level 11: 400
  Level 21: 1,600
  Level 31: 3,600
  Level 41: 6,400
  Level 51: 10,000 (100 tribute)

If you are in a clan, all merit you have donated automatically goes into the
clan's tribute pool.  If you are not in a clan, you'll have a personal pool
that you will build, and when you join a clan it will be added to theirs.

Merit and tribute are clan currencies only.

is required that you hold the focus in order to link or unlink gear.  You may
link up to 5 items of your choice.  Being magical in nature, the focus may be
purchased from the magic shop.

{WNote{X: It does not consume the spirit focus to link an item.

When you die to an enemy player, any items linked to you will come with you.

The following item types may be linked:
Weapons
Armor
Clothing
Jewelry
Drink Containers
Lights
Floats
Containers (Will dump contents into the corpse if you die)

The general rule is that if an item can be permanently destroyed or is a gem

As long as the item is not already Broken, it will become Broken first.  If a

When a clanner dies, enemies may loot their corpse.  Up to 5 items may be
looted from a death, and if within 3 ticks not all items that can be looted
have been then all of them return to the victim.

Not everyone may loot an enemy's corpse.  Here is how it is assigned:
The player that lands the killing blow receives 1 item.
The player that deals the most damage (Maladictions have a damage value)
  receives 1 item.
The remaining 3 items are available to anyone who contributed, first come first
  serve.

Gems and coins do not count as part of the loot limit.

If a player dies to an NPC without their pkill timer active, up to 3 items may
be looted by anyone (The killing blow and highest damage items are not
available).  The remaining items will never return if it was an NPC kill.

A clanmate may not loot your corpse unless it was an NPC kill, as that exposes
you to risk of losing more items if they die or are stolen from.

Corpses will not rot as long as you are logged on.

kill, you must have at least one item available to loot from the corpse.

The kill offering is worth the same amount of tribute as the base kill, so if
you land the kill then offer it you will receive double the normal amount. (The
tribute you take from the victim is separate and is not modified by this).  If
you have not searched the corpse, the bonus merit will go directly into your
clan's tribute.  If you have searched the corpse your offering is tainted and

can in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,
hamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow
flag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung
victim will occasionally have trouble when moving from room to room.
Having high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,
but helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's
impressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short
duration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the

be old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be
found on spell pages.
~
0 'CRITICAL HIT'~
None~
0 1 none
Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes
that can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai
Berserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are
oldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They
do extra damage based on your level.

   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you
can buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced
critical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to
a warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance
of landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'
the damage curve is softened slightly.

  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with
bash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an
additional chance to land a critical strike.

  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or
bludgeoning.

 Example:       Cleric Paladin
        Has no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he
has basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he
has better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance
with all others, and a softer curve.

 Example:       Blademaster
        Has natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has

Spell Type: Light

    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,
not fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the
intense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid
blast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.

   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have
determined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.

Spell Type: Sound

    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in
a concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does
slightly less damage than the combat spell 'acid blast'.   It has the
potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of combat.
Those with higher CON are less likely to be stunned.

    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at
the New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may
have escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.

the shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb
the next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks

0 RITUAL~
None~

Syntax: ritual

   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.
 To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that
 has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.
 The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being
 successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.
 A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform
 the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes
 it more difficult.

 If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his
 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell
 after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never
 lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.
 It does not belong to any spell group.

 The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which
 is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether
 or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have
 only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.

 The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have
 to use study command.

0 PREFRESH PFRESH~
None~
0 1 none
Q: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?

A: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters
   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to
   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters
   to "refresh" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that
   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will
   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years
   and put everyone on a level playing field.

Q: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?

A: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you
   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken
   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all
   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish
   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation
   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you
   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.
   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,
   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.
   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if
   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal
   creation.

Q: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What
   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after
   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?

A: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are
   being discussed include giving out "xp vouchers" for the left over xp,
   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally
   decided, the answer will be posted here.

Q: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?

A: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through
   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this
   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc
   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using
   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can
   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so
   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.

Q: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,
   what good are they?

A: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to
   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you
   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will
   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices
   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.

Q: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.

A: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending
   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can
   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills
   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new
   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that
   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be
   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it
   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if
   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.

Q: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?

A: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take
   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the
   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.

Q: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my
   practice sessions that way?

A: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain
   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up
   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your
   practice sessions.

Q: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and
   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?

A: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your
   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal
   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,
   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find
   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.

Q: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?

A: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair
   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all
   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a "stock"
   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly
   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special
   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special
   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted
   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of
   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will
   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.

Q: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?

A: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing
   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we
   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you
   chose to change races.

Q: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available
   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?

A: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and
   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for
   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes
   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an "old class".
   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level
   and a few other things like delays on skills.

Q: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?

A: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the
   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5
   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,
   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're
   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will
   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort
   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.
   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more
   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be
   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.

Q: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want
   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan
   system?

   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can
   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be
   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used
   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader
   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change
   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,
   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan
   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).

Q: What about my Mutant characters?

A: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,
   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not
   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain
   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once
   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to
   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you
   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.

Q: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I
   think of something not covered in this help file?

A: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had
   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be
   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that
   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially
   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding
   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an
   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either
   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the
   Admins.

FINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of
            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note
            to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider
            adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.

0 MYRMIDON~

Myrmidon
Concept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.
The military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the
martial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,
and the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.
However, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat
and is a skilled and powerful fighter.

Benefits:
* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already
when he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.
* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,
myrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second
and third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending
on the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.
* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a
fourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon
and level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the
time, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of
the time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.

Drawbacks:
* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less
familiar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they
fight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different
size (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).
This penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.

The teachings of Dae'tok are not compatible with the Myrmidon style. As
such, Yinns may not become myrmidons.

THE PAB IS NOT CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED

The player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.

Each clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.

Meetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.

A perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana
reach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and hard to control ability to
become completely invisible at will.  He can't easily control when this happens
or when it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in
combat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,
the Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,
called the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer
manages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically
outfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use

   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,
many of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or
mudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first
things you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The
"score" command contains most of the relevant information about your character.
The "worth" and "attrib" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes

MHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2

TRAINS and PRACTICES
   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By
gaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and
use new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will
begin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills
will naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing
them.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will
eventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which
this happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you
need to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the
signs to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your
class to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1
{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).
Simply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill
that you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will
increase by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you
practice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.
The highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything
beyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.
You begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time
you level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x
sessions you receive.

   Your character also has 6 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her
abilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x,
{Ywisdom{x, {Yconstitution{x and {Ycharisma{x.

See the individual help files for each for detailed information on how
they affect your character.

{YAttributes{x start at a specific value depending on what race and
class you selected. To improve your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x
session.  You begin with 3 {Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more
every time you level.  Your {Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually
start out between 10 and 15. You will want to train your {YCON{x and
{YSTR{x first.  This action also requires a trainer.  There is one in the
newbie school.  These trainers are not always the same as the {Gpractice{x
trainers.

MHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3

LEVELS and RULES CHANGES

   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,
you'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you
will no longer be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in
the world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of
his/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will
until level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts
(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about
these changes as you approach level 11.

   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called
"levelling gear."  Anything can technically be "levelling gear", but this
term generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about
to level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,
and {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).
Where do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best
bet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to
reach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less
experience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters
to slaughter that are more of a challenge.

Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied
the metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able
to identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class
or not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,
can sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a
variety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid
spellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.

   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be
found on clan road.  Other bankers may be located elswhere in the land.
You may only deposit eggs or platinum bricks into the bank, and they must
be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs and
 bricks in the bank are listed in your score.  You do not collect interest
and there is no minimum balance.  Your funds are completely safe in the bank.

If you attempt to withdraw more eggs or bricks than you have, you will not
withdraw any.  If you attempt to deposit more than you are carrying, you will
deposit them all.  The bank will not convert eggs to bricks or bricks to eggs
for you.

Note that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal from you
when you go to make a deposit or withdrawal.  The bank is not responsible
for stolen items.

MudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a
third-party agent between two players who want to trade something,
or purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money
and items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove
the items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,
you get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other
person and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type
"trade approve" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type "trade approve"
for it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or
removing stuff from it, both people must type "trade approve" again.

0 1 none
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'imm') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

Since the sun first shined down upon Boinga, there have always been
a few individuals that are encompassed by their extreme desire for
wealth, power, and position.

These covetous individuals of Boinga have joined together to form
Clan Avarice.  Their universal greed is the strongest bond between
any of the existing clanners.

Avarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers
low.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in
outsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used
in amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.

Entrance Requirements:
 -Must be level 20+
 -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)

Avarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order
to ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect
tests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you
choose to join the ranks of Avarice.

Avarice Charter (rules)

 -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,
  berzerker, monk)
 -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.
  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has
    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your
    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.
 -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER.
 -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.
 -Read those again.  Avarice does not trust outsiders be they clanners
  or non-clanners.  You may sell items and services, as this is part
  of your clan ideals.  But you are not Matookers or Honor.
 -There will be no alliances with any clans.

See 'help avarice sanction' for sanctioning information.

Avarice is not a sin, it's a way of life...

It is a time of ideals,

of HONOR!!

We are truly now the new generation of HONOR clansmen and women.
Our forefathers began the quest for justice and truth a millennia ago,
on the plains of Northern Midgaard. Blood and tears were shed to regain
HONOR once lost, and alas, is lost once again!!

In the past Clan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a

great cost in lives. The evil were caught, drawn, quartered and hung.
These old reminders remain there even today, remember my brethern...the
folly in betrayal, and the swift hand of vengeance!

CLAN HONOR's ideals come from the very heart of it's members. We exist to
purge this realm of evil that exists in the minds and souls of many, and as
it seems leads more into its grasp every day. We must stand strong together
to strive to assist our own, no matter what the cost, especially in
accomplishing the first goal.

If YOU believe in yourself, in truth, in HONOR, and wish to join the family
called HONOR, you must first send a note to 'HONOR' stating your intentions.
You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, or Lord to direct
you to the person who will give you your quest. Expect a rigorous interview,
and a test of your skills!

Stand strong together my brethern, for the paths of false HONOR may lead to
your own death!

In the land of Boinga, in a time forgotten by most, there was a spellcaster
whose name has also been lost. He was travelling the land and noticed that
there was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'
comprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters
so as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his
faithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that
had the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and
his brethren were made to pay with their lives.

Here we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials
of time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our
plight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide
into three sects.

Those who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through
kindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain
knowledge of the magical arts.

Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help
with clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to
recruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.

Those who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to
punish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our
clan against those who would wage war.

Our goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for
all those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will
put you in touch with our recruitment officers.


Entrance Requirements:

* You must be a pure spellcaster
  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)

Warlock Charter (rules)
*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:
   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader
   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.

*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.

The Legion of the Goblin Hoard.
Long ago a new race was formed, offshoots from the human race, the Goblin
came into being. They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their
race going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to
the lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became
obvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend
off the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.

The Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.
If you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of
races far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.
The Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.
Any race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become
anything more then just a guardsman.

If you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must
contact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one
on-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed
around roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan.
If you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of
protecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited
the weak for this task.

LONG LIVE THE LEGION!

The Clan Circle

    "As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of
Magic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting."

    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives
us, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief
of clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-
come.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development
and increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and
strength.

    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in
which we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,
corpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a
clan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,
the Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle
are the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and
willing to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.

    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying
that is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per
the basic "no multiplaying" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay
and develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income
is also encouraged but not required.

Circle Leadership and Law

    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are
elected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in
Circle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle
are given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect
that all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.

Joining Circle

    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,
and we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves
are welcome to apply for admission.

    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must
have at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.
Because dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells
are considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.

    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle
or Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post
a note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All
applicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to
complete a quest.

agree upon for themselves.

To become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5

In life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and
those who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the
land of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once
stepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to
follow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were
part of the family of BALANCE.

In the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and
able to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's
slave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to
become what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk
among us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation
Balance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling
that they took precedence over the many...

And so this continued until one day few were left. They decided
to make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than
follow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would
have sheep rather than friends.

With that Balance was reborn!

Balance is a family of members, none being any more important than
any other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant
state of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above

others.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they
will give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member
is one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This
is so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before
completing entrance into our clan.

The Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.
The speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the
spokesperson to the outside world.

The words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.
These children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one
true God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old
alike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false
faiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse
the lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan
men.

These children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound
heart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:

Zealot.

The faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the

Noone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of

----------------------------Ranking----------------------------

/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]
The members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading
the teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to
the heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow
brethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching
of new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the
cleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.
They also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.

/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]
The members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of
eliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen
filth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.
The creed: "There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of
blood." is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to
heart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this
is not their main task.

/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]
These members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention
when the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report
directly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the
congregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime
tasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of
funds of the clan.

All Ranks: Inquisitors.
Due to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the
clan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within
the clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed
are weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or
directly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which
might be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?
That knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.
All inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any
inquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,
or become an outcast at worst.

Ranks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated
as such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become
boastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,
and is highly frowned upon.

/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory
The Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.
These select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given
responsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own
branch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report
directly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the
clan.

/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.
These chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within
the church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct
voice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.
These people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek
advice on internal matters as they so choose.

-1 POSSE~
None~
0 1 none
A band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,
killing, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band
were a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams
and death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they
formed a Posse.

The Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about
the world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and
RUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.

Posse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,
THIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.
Taking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the
above flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the
understanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also
that accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident
will be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually
unacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an
outcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating
circumstances, again as the situation dictates.

We are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that
we help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups,
or even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry
flags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our
greater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.

Posse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races
and classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.
Players are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to
not invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.
Teamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not
required.

Sanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble
following the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and
will generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5
you ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time
they will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how
long they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to

remove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:

Ruffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer
Thug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.
Killer and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked.

Entrance Requirements:

* You may not have a flag (see definition below).

Posse Charter (rules)

- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),
  is to be killed.
- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for
  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.
- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.

And when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was
given unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its
inhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great
sword...

And behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair
of balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of
dust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which
nourishes the body--and the spirit...

And lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose
arrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to
disfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...

And behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell

And power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with

[Premise]
We are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we
are but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or
destruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our
purpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably
must, and will be.

Those who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience
with the proper Incarnation.

Warriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.
Thieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.
Clerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.
Mages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.

Outcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They
are, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in
their lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are
a few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:

-- Attacking a fellow clan member
-- Stealing from a fellow clan member
-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan
-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership
-- Receiving a DWEEB flag
-- Spying for another Clan
-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention

Once someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless
a voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs.

Dweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the
gods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be
attacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can
bestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for
a Dweeb flag:

-- Continually spamming the public channels.
-- Continually harrassing particular players.
-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.
-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.
-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.
-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.
-- Using CB lingo on public channels
-- Using l33t speak on public channels
   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use
    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)

Note that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings
before you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to
have done something truly horrendous.

Also, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the
period of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you
must live with it.

Help 'Matook'
Matook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest
in dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they
can.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse
retrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the
individual is willing to do.

The helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church
in the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many
helpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing
and mana recouperation rooms for the needy.

If you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to
join their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and
knowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of
the Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be
willing to answer any further questions about the the Church in
general and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any
area. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference
is always forbidden.

"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's
fate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease."

-May Matook Protect You.

Moosehead has gone through a state of Player Refreshing. This character has
not yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the
creation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better
balance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed
and you can do it at another time.

You can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of
here with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you
pfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.

If you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend
'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in
the game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.

52 JOBS~
None~

As an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and
especially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what
it is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's
expected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.

Note:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.

All levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is
cheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of
a higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings
with mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as
you would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of
an Immortal.

52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive
or have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,
save to follow the same rules as everyone else.

53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an
Immortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how
you act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if
you are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be
placed at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the
rules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the
land, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of
being an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob
strength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking
questions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.

55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available
to you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'
stage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level
where you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be
given a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations
at this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn
OLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.
You have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any
major decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced
Immortal.

57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to
Immortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used
to penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you
should have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,
and a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at
this level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,
build on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.
Your conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but
you're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'
once you've reached this point.

58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp
of the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any
situation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to
Senior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some
of the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all
Immortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected
for their dedication to MHS.

59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still

keeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have
their hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available
on MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,
you have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,
or you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure
about, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS
inside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins
are also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new
code for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.

60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor
is, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
None~
0 1 none
MHS has a separated system of player killing (pkilling), implemented via clans.
Players that do not join a clan are not able to be pkilled, and those players
that do join a clan (clanners) should make a conscious effort not to involve
non-clanners in any pkilling (or pstealing) actions.

If you are not clanned you must avoid interfering with pkilling as much as you
can.  This includes even indirect interference.  If in doubt, do nothing.

You may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are
more than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim
is not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF
or DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more
than 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above
actions you will receive a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.
Also other players may get to attack you.

There are specific ways to get certain flags:
(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a
     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you
     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another
     player while you have no other flags.
(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged
     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who
     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to
     another player.
(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This
     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This
     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending
     on the number of players killed as a thug.
(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in
     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you.
     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of
     another player.

When attacking somebody who origionally isn't able to attack you (Such as a
player that is too many levels above you), that person gains the right to
attack you until they have killed you.

Is it worth it?  You decide.

                         **********************

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.

3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.

4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.

5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.

6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.

7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.

9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!

And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"

These are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.

* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and
  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be
  tolerated.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT
  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned
  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.
  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are
  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights
  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.

* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.
  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or
  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa
  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other
  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive.

  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or
  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie
  without their permission still is illegal.

* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.
  This includes using a script away from your terminal.
  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.
  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you
  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your
  typing woes, not play your character for you.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters,
  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1
  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under
  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are
  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that
  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,
  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special
  privileges.
  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know
  who someone's "alt" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over
  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are
  seperate.

* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait
  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between
  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait
  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.

* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.
  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.
  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.
  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too

 (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from
  a pfight then dont take it.)

* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless
  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with
  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the
  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.

* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and
  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for
  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are
  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that
  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To
  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob
  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with
  them do not help them level.

* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to
  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.

* Channel "spamming" and personal attacks on someone over public channels
  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to
  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse
  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,
  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.

* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly
  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you
  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised
  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.

* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave
  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while
  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill
  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT
  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.
  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal
  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less
  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.

  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)
  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)
  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go
   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).

* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be
  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have
  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to
  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage
  character shall be denied.

* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow
  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is
  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.

* Other rules for clanned players are found in "Help Clan"

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason.

* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty
  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for
  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could
  increase the duration of your penalties.

* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.
  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs
  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when
  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base
  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on
  the web that have posting boards for such things, such as:
  http://www.mudconnector.com/

* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same
  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break
  these rules.

* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you
  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means
  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in
  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your
  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are
  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.

* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential
  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so
  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing
  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or
  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts
  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections
  are logged and will be watched.

* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and
  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be
  tolerated.

* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor

0 CLANLIFE~
Clan Clist Loner Outcast~
1358566967 8 Slodhian
Throughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common
cause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the
spread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.

In order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,
either by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name
of their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4
beside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as
follows:

You must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast
of any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either
joined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.

Once you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If
for some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you
must first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.

Expect to be looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your
life miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, making sure to link items
that you particularily care to keep around.

See help clan for a list of other helpfiles that can point you to details about
the clan system.

0 KNIGHT~
None~
0 1 none
Individuals who have  studied the art of mounted combat are the Knights
in Boinga.  They must rely on their strength and constitution in order to
endure the long hours of Knight school.

Knights have the unique ability to call forth a warhorse using the
{Ccall mount{x spell.  Even the larger races, who are unable to ride current
mounts, can ride their magestic warhorses.  The warhorse's time on this
world is limited.

Knights also have the ability to charge their opponents with the {Ckcharge{x
skill.  The kcharge attack can only be used to initiate combat, as it is
very difficult to do a charge in melee.

Knights from the warrior or blademaster classes must wield a polearm
in order to kcharge.  Knights from the cleric or paladin classes must wield
a flail in order to kcharge.

NOTE:  The riding skill is *NOT* included in the Knight kit.  In order to
       use your warhorse with any proficiency, you must take this skill
       in addition to the knight kit.
       {YALSO!!!{x
       Knights are no longer given the polearm and flail skills they require
       to do the kcharge attack depending on your class.  There are now

Branch Clan halls

Initial room, guard, and discription - free

Your guard corps start out as entry level.  You may pay for
training for your entire guard corps.  This training includes
all guards on staff at your branch hall. Should decide to hire more
guards, they will have the same level of training and ability
as your existing corps.   Prices for training your guards or
hiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.

Clan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment,
however stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined
and will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or
upgrade-able.

You may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.

A Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,
and boots.

Branch offices will be open to all clanners, that is
why you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an
enemy invade your branch hall.

You will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch
clan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return
to your main hall, you will have to use your traditional
means of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere,
meaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you.
However, you will not be able to use scan from inside your
branch hall.  You will have to go outside. The entrance to
your branch hall is a secret entrance.

Clan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their
branch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your
alls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.
Prices for additions to your branch halls are the same as
those in the "help prices" file.  Branch halls may not have
portals or obs rooms.  Branch halls may not have locking doors,
private rooms, owner only, or clan specific only rooms.
Every room in a branch hall will be open to all clanners.

Portals are NO LONGER AVAILABLE you may put a branch hall in an area of your
choosing.

Immortals:
See the help BHALLS file for vnums.

0 DOT 'DAMAGE OVER TIME'~
None~
0 1 none
Damage Over Time (also called DOT) affects are special types of spell affects.
A DOT affect doesn't cycle with normal spell affects, it has its own timer
and is not looked at during normal ticks.  DOTs use a special, faster tick
that kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,
doing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but
this isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low
amounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this
very reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of
damage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can
use several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes
and do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage
a DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.

The Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT
spells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.
Other, more mundane DOT spells exist.

Use edithelp (Or ehelp) to edit help files.  When done, be sure to use save.
Available commands are:
ehelp new (Creates a new file)
ehelp edit (Selects a file to edit)
ehelp list <keyword> (Lists files with matching keywords)
ehelp editor <name> lists any helpfiles edited by the exact player <name>
ehelp sort <status> (Lists files with matching statuses)
Available status options: Legacy, draft, review, final.  Legacy means the
  help file has not been modified with the new system.  Draft help files
  will not display on live.  Review and Final both will transfer to live.
* Any commands after this point require you be editing a help file to use. *
ehelp show (Shows current help file)
ehelp details (Editing information on current help file)
ehelp text (Edits the help file's main text)
ehelp level (Sets the help file's level. Use -1 to hide the green bars)
* Use of -1 should be kept to things like motd where the bars are
  inappropriate. Most help files should be at 0 or higher. *
ehelp keywords <keywords> (Sets help file's keywords. 'keys' works too)
ehelp status <status> (Sets the help file's status. Draft, review, or final)
ehelp related <related> (Sets what help files are related to the current)
ehelp save (Saves your current work)

55 'EHELP STANDARDS' 'EDITHELP STANDARDS'~
Ehelp~
1358306623 1 Andaron
Editing helpfiles comes with a responsibility to make good changes. The last
person to edit a helpfile will have their name recorded with it -- if you
find a helpfile that is inappropriate, you should discard any changes you
have made (If you save you become the last to modify it) and talk to an
appropriate admin about the issue.

Setting the level of the helpfile should be done to match the intended
audience.  If it's immortals only, it should be level 52.  If it's only
builders and higher, it should be level 55.  Level -1 will make the helpfile
not show the header and footer, but should be reserved only for special
helpfiles such as the wizlist.

Legacy status is only intended for helpfiles that have not been edited, and
upon first save a helpfile will move from Legacy to Review (If you do not
set it manually).  Draft status will NOT show on live, so should be used
only for new helpfiles, or help files that you don't want to be viewable
(Because they're not relevant currently, or for any similar reason.) Review
status will indicate to other imms that you would like the helpfile reviewed
but that you feel it's good enough to go live as it is.  So review will show
up on live.  Final status means that you feel it's done as it is, and it
will go live.

Take responsibility for your edits, make the helpfiles useful, and everyone
will be happy.

This guide has become more than simply a FUNIE, but an OLC reference for
all immortals or builders using OLC.
 
The original version was composed by Talltrees with container and 
furniture updates by Rebecca, and several other immortals fighting 
the olc.  Please note that with todays players and our ever changing 
code, some of the recommended 'stats' may actually be a little low or 
weak, You cannot keep these values absolute, you need to use them as 
guide and try them out with mortals.. Try them out, test them and modify 
to taste.  Remember, only YOU really know how tough you want your mobs 
to be, and often the best way to create mobs or objects of a certain 
calibre is to copy the stats from mobs you're familiar with in the game 
already.  The hardest thing to remember when you first start on OLC is 
that the Values start with Value 0.  So, if you see Value 3 mentioned 
here, it is actually the fourth value in.  If you run into trouble and 
you can't figure out why, double check your Values.

As elementalists grow they gain ability to control thunder.
With this power they can actually manipulate elements to harm
victim in non-electric way, But by sound causing them immerse pain.

This is a new quest type for game. where it is, how to work with it
is up for you. But everyone can join... BUT
not all may survive the task ahead, with only your own wit guiding you.
 
It's optional automatic quest, which resets if no one participates
or finishes the quest in time. 
 
There is a prize in end, but there are so many prizes that you need to learn
them by yourself
 
Everyone is equal in eyes of ...

Capsules are items that can contain other items.  Setting up a capsule is
fairly straightforward.  Once you've set the item type, to control what
the capsule drops when opened you set its values:
 
Value 0: Amount of xp to award, from 0 to 1000.
Value 1: Amount of silver to award, from 0 to 110000. This will convert to
  gold when appropriate (120 silver = 1 gold 20 silver)
Value 2: Amount of skill points to award, from 0 to 5.
Value 3: Vnum of item to award, 0 for no item.
Value 4: Variance % for xp and silver, from 0 to 100. 0 will always give
  the exact amount for xp and silver, while 100 will go anywhere from 0
  to 200% the amount (It does plus and minus the input %). Standard value
  if you want variance is 5-10%.
 
Be responsible with your rewards and don't put the bigger values on things
when not appropriate. While almost any vnum may be contained in a capsule
the item slot is mostly meant for gems or other such trinkets.
 
Note that a capsule is not a valid item to have in a capsule.

Capsules are special objects that may be opened to claim whatever treasure
they may have inside!  What will that be?  Nobody knows, until you open it!

You may remove clanner from clan, or allow non-clanner into clan
but, within rules. 
 
Once joined into clansystem, Clanners can not be removed from clansystem
without admin approval. Same goes for non-clanners.
