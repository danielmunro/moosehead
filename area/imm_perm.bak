{RKarag's {DGruff{x, spikey {YHUG{x!!~
You have entered something...its cold in here...and hard and theres lots of 
scary things moving around on the floor. You can hear a whispering sound 
coming from all directions. With a sudden terrifying realization, you
remember that last thing that happened to you. Karag gave you a hug. You 
are still within the hug. Thats just weird. Then you remember all the 
sounds of voices and realize Karags hug was not friendly, it was evil and
at this very moment is delivering your soul unto his weapon. If that wasnt 
enough, the things on the floor are clustering around you. Dont try to
make sense of it, just RUN!
