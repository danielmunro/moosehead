friendly warrior~
a friendly warrior~
A friendly warrior stands here, casually leaning on his sword.
~
This man does not appear to be one to mess with.  Bulging muscles flex easily
on his arms, and he is clearly skilled in his craft. Luckily, he appears to be
in good spirits, so you shouldn't have to worry.

gruff shopkeeper~
a gruff shopkeeper~
A gruff shopkeeper stands here looking impatient and annoyed.
~
The shopkeeper is a short man who appears to have overcompensated for his lack
of height by developing muscles far too large for his frame.  Barely able to
place his arms by his side, or place his feet together, he totters slightly
and occasionally appears as though he might topple into the merchandise on the
walls.  He notices you and blows one of the last hairs on his head out of his
sweaty face.  His tiny hands flail wildly on his robust arms as he grumbles at
you, "Come on, come on then.  Whattya want?"

calm warrior~
a calm warrior~
A calm warrior stands here, looking quite zen.
~
This warrior appears to have seen some serious battles, but his scars are oddly
offset by a very calm demeanor.  He is quite tall, and looms quite large, but
is dressed in soft, white clothing, with a demeanor more like a healer than
a warrior.  He nods slowly, "I know, it looks strange.  Please, come in and
tell me what you wish to practice, I can help."

a confident gladiator~
A confident gladiator waves to the crowd, calm before his fight.
~
This warrior seems to be pretty sure about his chances, easily and calmly
walking around the arena, waving to the ladies and winking at the children
in the grandstands. He swings his sword in an exaggerated arc, much to the
pleasure of the children watching and dreaming of a day when they will be
big, strong gladiators, too.

hellhound hell hound~
a grotesque hellhound~
A grotesque hellhound stares you down like he can already taste you.
~
You can smell him before you see him - an odor combining sulfur and decay,
blood and ashes. A large mass of pitch black fur huddles in the corner,
shivering in his rage. His fur is darkened by large swaths of drying blood,
left here by warriors that have come before you. He snarls, a full set of
sharp, yellowed teeth bared at you. His eyes peel open, flames dancing
behind them, as he sees you and marks you as his prey.

half-dead warrior~
a half-dead warrior~
A half-dead warrior lies in a heap here, moaning and wailing.
~
Oh, what a sad sight this is.  This warrior will not live to see another day or
to ever feel warm sunlight streaming across his skin.  Alas, the battle has done
him in.  He is torn nearly to shreds and are those...those are guts.  Yes, his
guts are on the outside, leaking from a deep slice across his abdomen.  He looks
at you with pleading eyes, yelling, "Please!  For the love of the Gods, help me!"
 
Of course, you could always be a good person and put him out of his misery.  A
few quick slices of your blade is all it will take.

She sits delicately in her chair, chastely sipping red wine. Occasionally, she
steals a glance around her, her loving but secretive gaze falling often on the
handsome man sitting next to her.

the stench of death and decay~
The stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the air.
~
The stench in the air is palpable. Many, many corpses in various stages of decay
are scattered from wall to wall, floor to ceiling, piled up as though merely
an afterthought. You can almost see the waves of nauseating odor rising from
the bodies and piles of misplaced guts and appendages. You have to fight your
way through it as your eyes water and bile rises up in your throat.

~
The old man spots you and immediately starts over towards you.  He is dressed in
fine, silken robes of ivory and gold, a heavy looking book tucked under one arm.
His forehead wrinkles in confusion and he speaks to you quietly, as though he
doesn't wish to be seen or heard, "Where am I?  I must have taken a wrong turn
and I definitely don't think this is the Temple of Serenity."  He tsks as he
looks around warily, "No, no, this is definitely not the right place.  Would
you be so kind as to escort me to safety?"
 
Well, would you?

beckons you over, yelling gleefully, "You'll never see a more beautiful rose
in your life! Did you know that some flowers have healing properties?"  He nods

This guy doesn't seem to care much if you notice him or his wares, and in fact,
he almost seems to be a bit bored.  Flies buzz around piles of different meats
that are piled on a table by type, the meat browning around the edges as it
oxidizes.  Large slabs of meat slung up on ropes are also swarmed by the bugs,
and the smell from the booth is not the most appetizing.

striped in red and yellow.  He is surrounded by shelves full of what appear to
be toys geared towards the little ones who might be attending today's arena
games.  He catches you looking and immediately begins to wave his hands around
the shelves piled high with noise makers, hobby-horses and pretend weaponry and
armor, yelling to you to come take a look, promising you that you'll like what
you see.

slightly stained by time, and her hair and makeup isn't as fine as some of the

A female warrior rests on the ground, her legs outstretched. The woman doesn't
fit the description of what most people might imagine when they think of a female
warrior.  Her arms and legs are long, lean and well-muscled, her skin tanned to
a golden brown. She wears only what she requires, a mere few scraps of soft,
brown leather covering the parts you'd expect - but, little more. She notices
you staring and smirks, offering in a deep, soothing voice, "Stretching is very
important for strength and agility. You should join me."

Entrance to Fighter School~
You have entered a dark, cold room.   Candles burn within sconces on the grey stone
walls, casting shadows all about the place.  The room is small and mostly unadorned,
save for a sign held to the wall with a silver dagger.   It looks important.  There
are exits to your east and west.

Welcome, Fighters!
 
West - Fighter School
 
Here you will learn basic commands and fighting tricks.  You can train
and practice, as well as browse the shop.  New characters and anyone
new to mudding should spend some time within the school.  Relax, take
your time, and take in all there is to learn.  When you feel ready,
head to the east to try out your fighting skills.
 
East - Battle Training
 
There are monsters to the east, so be on watch.  Be careful to read signs
and stick to areas designed for your level.

A Stone Chamber~
You have entered a cavernous stone chamber.  The air is still and chilly,
a slightly stale odor permeating the space.  An archway leads to the west,
where you can see a fireplace burning brightly.  To the north lies a long
hallway.

The Library~
You enter a cozy room that is in stark contrast to the pale, cold chamber
just outside.  A large fireplace roars against the far wall, the burning
wood crackling and popping as the fire warms and brightens the room. The
other walls are lined with books and scrolls, all of them well-worn. Soft,
plush rugs have been placed near the fire for those who wish to rest while
they read.
 
Look at the bookshelf to see which books are available.  Players new to Muds
or new to this mud are encouraged to read them.

descriptions descrip~
Roleplay is not enforced here on MHS, so descriptions are not mandatory.
 
That having been said, every truly great character should have one.
 
A few tips:
 
*  Try not to tell other people how they're feeling in your description.
   While you might think you are a big, scary dragon, you can't assume
   everyone else will think that you are.
 
*  Try to get a mental image of your character.  What might someone notice
   about you if they were to look at you?  What does your face look like?
   How tall are you?  Any scars showing?  Try to think of unique details
   to make your character stand out.
 
*  Try to be realistic.  Everyone wants to imagine that their character is
   the baddest in the land, the biggest, the strongest.  The most interesting
   characters are those with both flaws and merits.
 
*  A description should tell someone nothing more than they would know
   just by looking at you.  Try not to include background on your character,
   or any other facts or trivia I wouldn't know just from looking at you.
 
 
Overall, have fun with it.  It's not required, but everyone loves a good
description.  Feel free to ask any immortal for help if you need it.

Trains and Practices~
Each level, regardless of race and class, characters receive 1 train.
Trains can be used to increase any of your stats one point (until they 
are at maximum) or can be used to add 10 points to your total hp, mana, 
or movement.  They can also be converted into 10 practices.  Trains may
be bought back after being converted to trains, but at a hefty price.
It costs 20 practices to gain back a train.
 
Each level you will gain a number of practices.  The number of 
practices that you earn will depend on your Wisdom stat.  The higher it
is, the more practices you receive upon level.  You can use practices
to practice your skills and spells.  Type "prac" to see all your 
available spells and skills, and what level your currently have them
practiced to.  You can only practice a skill or spell to 75%.  The rest
must be earned through use.
 
You can also use practices to purchase new skills and spell groups.  At
your trainer, type "gain list" to see what you can gain and how much 
everything costs.  You can also use practices to take kits.  Please 
read the Kit scroll to learn more about kits.

tips for leveling~
The most important thing, when leveling, is to raise your stats as closely
to max as is possible.  You can do this by using trains to raise your stats
naturally, or by using equipment that is enhanced to raise your stats while
you wear it.  Your strength stat will affect how many hit points you gain when
you level.  You Constitution also affects your hit point gains.  Your Wisdom
controls how many practices you earn each level and also affects your mana
gains.  Intelligence heavily affects your mana gains.  Dexterity determines
how many movement points you earn each level - and, movement can be more
important than you'd think.
 
Each race has their own specific maximums for each stat.  Make sure to max
yours out when you level!
~
E
score sheet~
Your score sheet is all of the technical information about your character,
wrapped up in one neat little package.  You'll notice your name and age
at the top of the score sheet. Your age is based on the number of real
life hours you've spent playing, which you can see next to your age. The
next line is pretty obvious - your hit points, mana and movement. Hit
points are your life force - when they're gone, you're dead. Mana is your
resource for casting spells. Movement determines how long you can walk
around without needing to rest, and is also used for many warrior skills.
 
Below that, you see your race, sex, class, and kit, if you have one (type
'look kit' for more info).  On the next line you can see how many trains
and practices you have available to you, as well as how many skill points
you have accrued.  Just after that is your bounty, if you have one, which is
the amount of gold that has been placed on your head.
 
Below that are your stats: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity,
Constitution and Charisma.   Then, you see your total experience gained
and amount of gold and silver on hand.  Below that is what you have 'wimpy'
set for.  The wimpy command sets the percentage of hit points that you
want to automatically flee at.  If you set it to 20, you will flee when you 
only have 20 percent of your hit points remaining.
 
Then, your score sheet will show your current position (sleeping, standing,
resting), and below that is your saving throw. You want this number to be
negative, and the lower it is, the better.  This number determines how well
you resist spells cast on you.
 
Then you see how well armored you are, and this is a number you want to
keep as low and negative as possible.  After you reach a certain level, you
will see your hit and dam rolls at the bottom of your score sheet. These 
numbers tell you how often you hit, and how hard.  Finally, at the bottom of
your score sheet, you will see your current alignment, and the total "sac"
points you have.  Sac points (or sacrifice points) are gained whenever you
sacrifice a mob or object.  Depending on the diety you chose to worship
(help deity), sac points can be used to "pray" (help pray) for certain 
special abilities.

This is quite a zen room, and has been decorated to show just that.  It's a
small room, but much has been made of the space.  A large sculpture of ivy is
hung on one wall, water trickling down the metal decoration, the sound quite
soothing and pleasing.  A box of sand takes up most of the floor space, a rake
leaning against the wall beside it.  Fragrant incense burns on a corner table,
and a comfortable chair is available to relax in.

and the walls and floor are rough and unfinished.  The stairs below are lit, but
just barely, by an occasional candle on the wall.  There's a dense odor coming
from below; the smell of sweat and blood, fear and death.  Shouts of pain and
effort can be heard, faintly, along with the sporadic shout of victory.

roar.  The air is stale and musty, tinged with the scent of blood and decayed
flesh. Bones lie scattered throughout the room, forgotten.  The clashing of
swords can be heard in the distance, as well as the terrified screams of other
fighters.

This is a disgusting room.  Every inch of the place is covered with blood in
varying shades from fresh crimson to drying carmine.  Body parts lie in piles
around you, all of them chewed and mutilated to some degree.  A deep growling
permeates the small space.  It seems to be coming from the corner...

-=The Arena Entrance=-~
You stand at the gates to a great arena, bustling with activity. Cheers of
excitement rise up from behind the gates. The sounds of merchants peddling their
wares mix with the sounds of children playing and carrying on. The scent of fresh
bread and roasted meats fills the air, tempting you.

Inside the Arena~
You stand just inside the main arena gates.  There's an excitement in the air,
and the sounds of everything from swords clanging together as the gladiators
practice in anticipation of their battles - to the sounds of children squealing
in nervous delight.  The smells of roasted meats and incense surround you as the
hustle and bustle of people looking for seats creates a harried atmosphere.
A walkway continues north into the arena and towards the grandstands.

The Arena Floor~
Stepping out onto the arena floor, the loud hum of the crowd all around you,
the excitement of battle and competition is heavy in the air. Beneath your feet
is a mixture of packed dirt and hay. Gladiators of all sizes wander the arena
floor before the big event, waving to the crowds, the more confident and calm
gladiators joking with the children in the grandstands on either side of the
grounds. Many men have died in this arena, but for every man who failed, there
was a man who was victorious. Which will you be?

To your north, the arena stands are busy with men, women and children wandering
the stands for the best seat.  There is a definite excitement in the air, and a
buzz runs through the crowd as strangers and friends alike discuss the chances

Clearly hidden to the general public, this secret closet doesn't seem to be very
special or unique.  A few worn, dirty brooms rest against one wall, a shovel
lying at the ground at your feet.  It's nearly too dark to see in here, but a
shimmer of silver beneath a pile of dust catches your eye.

The Arena Grandstand~
The seating here in the stands offers a great view of the gladiator battles
going on below. Spectators of every age mill about, looking for the best seat.
The seating is crude, mere benches made of rough stone, but the stands are
covered by a bright red canopy, which provides fantastic shade from the bright
sunshine.

The Arena Floor~
Stepping out onto the arena floor, the loud hum of the crowd all around you,
the excitement of battle and competition is heavy in the air. Beneath your feet
is a mixture of packed dirt and hay. Gladiators of all sizes wander the arena
floor before the big event, waving to the crowds, the more confident and calm
gladiators joking with the children in the grandstands on either side of the
grounds. Many men have died in this arena, but for every man who failed, there
was a man who was victorious. Which will you be?

Under The Platform~
You stand in a cramped space below a wooden platform. Spiders of sizes and colors
that might further haunt your nightmares hang in wait on gossamer webs. Footfalls
hammer loudly above you, and the cheers from the crowd echo around you. A very
narrow, precariously hobbled together stairwell leads up.

The Royal Platform~
This platform was designed for any royals or dignitaries who might be attending
the gladiator events. People of this rank and stature simply don't sit with the
riff raff. Velvet-lined chairs rest along the platform next to fine wooden tables
on which the select few might place their cold drinks. An intricately carved wooden
beam stretches across the front of the platform, protecting those watching from
the brutal action below.
