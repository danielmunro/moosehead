The Peak before the Cathedral~
You are standing in the crisp air atop a high mountainous peak. Dominating 
the view in front of you is a majestic cathedral, balancing on the edge of 
the peaks pinnacle. A bird of prey cries out from somewhere high above you. 
There is a small winding path ahead of you, leading down to the cathedral 
doors. You cannot remember how you got here!

Winding Path to the Cathedral~
You begin the walk down to the cathedral. The great spires loom closer and 
you begin to make out grotesque shapes, faces and creatures glaring and 
perching around the cathedral walls. The path continues north, coming 
extremely close to the peak edge. You peer over and a vertical cliff face 
greets you with a sudden updraft of warm wind. The path continues north to 
the cathedral.

At the Cathedral Doors~
You have reached the cathedral doors. The plain dark wooden doors were 
obviously built for their purpose, to let people in and out, not for 
grandeur. You can now make out the ominous carvings, one of which is 
directly above you, a menacing gargoyle, partnered with a shrieking harpy,
you suddenly do not feel welcome here.

The Cathedral of Life or Death~
The door creaks closed behind you, shutting out the light. It takes a
second for your eyes to adjust to the dim candlelight glowing around the 
room. Once they adjust you are amazed by the sheer size of this place, the 
cathedral looked big on the outside, but not this big! A huge open space, 
with a single red carpet lines the cathedral space from east to west, the 
east ending at a dark window from floor to ceiling and the west at a plain 
stone alter. Great pillars of stone rise at intervals along the cathedral 
floor, stretching far into the ceiling, but disappearing in a shroud of 
shifting darkness.

The Cathedral of Life or Death~
You step onto the red carpeted walkway, the length of the cathedral runs 
east to west on either side of you. You are now closer to the centre of the 
cathedral. You can see flaming braziers attached to the pillars along the 
stretch of the cathedral. The same grotesque figures appear above you. They 
are just as vile and threatening, but steeped in shadows of moving flame 
light, they seem almost alive.

Before the Black Window~
A massive black window seems to rise here out of the very mist from floor 
to ceiling. Through it you can make out an outline of a jagged peak, 
shrouded in mist. A full moon, resting above the pinnacle of the peak 
struggles to penetrate its light through the dark window.

Before the Altar~
You continue west along the carpeted walkway beneath the towering darkness 
above you. The braziers light extends only so far, shrouding this area in a
muted light. The altar itself is made from a grey, black-veined stone, 
seamless in its construction. A small candle rests, newly lit, atop the 
altar. The flame from the small candle light casts a flickering glow across 
an ancient looking book. Beyond the altar, through a small door, you can 
see a stairway spiralling down.
