A Crystallized Goblin Miner stands here, hacking crystals.
~
A goblin miner stands here, hacking away at the crystalline walls. A 
rusting copper helmet rests unevenly atop  its head, providing miniscule 
protection, especially for its long crooked nose. Its short frame and torso 
are covered by a rudimentary boiled leather apron. The goblins short thin 
legs rest inside what could only be called mining "Troggstompers", leather 
and copper made shoes way too big for its feet, however, obviously 
providing ample protection from falling crystal shards. There is something 
odd about this goblin... its skin has taken on a metallic green sheen. The 
crystals it has been mining seems to be growing over its skin!

A Crystallized Goblin stands here, manning a winch.
~
A goblin stands here manning a winch. He is struggling to hold a rope, 
together with a number of other goblins. This goblin looks similar to the 
miners you saw further up the shaft, however its skin has been almost 
completely dominated by the crystal growth, it almost looks like a 
completely different creature! The creature snarls at you but is too 
occupied with its task to do more.

A Crystallized Goblin Overseer~
A Crystallized Goblin Overseer stands here, shouting orders.
~
A large muscular goblin is standing here, ordering the other Goblins 
around. It seems to be better dressed in a light brown flannel shirt and 
trousers. A sturdy pair of iron tipped dark leather boots is protecting its 
feet while its bald head remains completely uncovered. Strong...but
definitely not smart. The Overseers skin does not seem to be affected by 
the crystals, perhaps because it is not coming into direct contact with 
them.

The Entrance to a Small Tunnel through the Whiteshard Mountains~
You are standing at the entrance of a small tunnel. The rock face ahead 
seems to have been hacked away, leaving a rugged hole just large enough to 
fit through. It looks as though the rubble and sand around the entrance has 
only recently fallen; leaving what is now an entrance through the 
mountains.

A Small Tunnel Through the Whiteshard Mountains~
You have climbed through the small opening and leave what was once the Old 
Goblin Headquarters behind. A small drop to the ground onto moist dirt
shows tracks of many small feet passing both ways. The tunnel itself seems 
to be made up of bone-white rocks shimmering slightly to an unknown light.
The tunnel widens slightly up ahead before curving sharply to the west.

A Wider Part of the Tunnel Through the Whiteshard Mountains~
You follow the shimmering rock wall further south into the mountain. The
walls here have been roughly hacked away, as if in a frenzy. Sharp
{Wwhite{x rocks protrude all around you like teeth, menacingly growling. If
it wasnt for the fact that the light was coming from somewhere, you would
have thought this a dead-end. The light seems to be coming from a small
vertical crack between the rocks to your left.

The Entrance to the Cavern of Shards~
You shave yourself through the crack in the rock only to be momentarily 
blinded by a {Gm{Ru{Cl{Wt{Gi{Rt{Cu{Wd{Ge{x of lights somewhere around you. Your eyes adjust to the
light but it is still difficult to focus on any specific point for long. You
have entered a cavernous space, brilliantly white and reflecting light
infinitely between the crystals lining the walls around you. You can see 
smaller tunnels veering off in all directions, all of them seem to glow and 
change colour in a kaleidoscope of lights, reflecting from further in. The
light must be coming from somewhere.

just to walk to the western side. The entrance to the glowing green tunnels
loom above you to the west while to the northeast the cavernous space extends
towards the red cave entrance. The east leads back to the entrance of the
cavern. Light continues to assault you from all sides, crystals constantly
gleaming and shimmering all around you.

The space within the cavern here is so large that it has taken a few minutes
just to walk to the north western corner. To the south you can just see the
outline of the green tunnels. The far south eastern cavern glows a soft blue
hue , another tunnel it would seem, dispersing its own coloured light to the
surrounding area. The southeast leads back to the entrance of the cavern.
Light continues to assault you from all sides, crystals constantly gleaming
and shimmering around you. The distant roof of the cavern looks just like a
perfect night sky.

You reach the north eastern corner after a few minutes of walking. The
ground here feels slightly softer; you noticed the ground colour change
slightly from here and on towards the south eastern tunnel, blue lights
flickering. You can still hear the faint clanging of something hitting
rock. "Clang...Clang". The shimmering red tunnel lies to your west and you
can see across the far south western cavern, the green tunnel displaying
its own array of colour. The cavern sparkles constantly around you.

The Eastern Side of the Cavern of Shards~
You have entered a large tunnel to the west of the Cave of Shards. These
western tunnels reflect light with a pulsating hue of white and green. For
some reason the crystals here have taken on a green hue, and continue to
reflect light from further up the tunnel. The rugged walls seem deceptively
soft, but on closer inspection show razor sharp edges. The sound of active
mining becomes louder the further you go into the tunnel. The tunnel leads 
further west, before angling to the north and out of sight.

A Tunnel in the Green Crystal Mines~
You follow the green tunnel further west, the crystal walls closing in 
around you. The sounds of mining and sheer curiosity have brought you 
face to face with a strange looking creature! Whatever it is, its mining 
crystals and ignoring your presence. Shards of green crystal fly in every 
direction, the shards landing on the floor around you, covering the tunnel 
floor in sharp, deadly looking shards. Careful where you walk!  The tunnel 
continues westward, the sounds of mining becoming more consistent, 
there are obviously a lot of the miners down this tunnel. The beauty of 
the crystals and the gleaming lights never cease to amaze you.

A Tunnel in the Green Crystal Mines~
The tunnel continues further into the Whiteshard mountains. More of 
the Goblin miners can be seen hacking away at the green crystals along 
the tunnel walls. An iron track has been laid into the compact crystalline 
floor. Wooden carts are being pushed slowly along by the miners, 
obviously using them to transport the crystals from deeper inside the 
mine. The Goblins do not seem affected by the constant shifting of light 
from the crystals around you. The tunnel curves slightly to the south 
around the next corner. The sound of winches and shouting goblins can 
be heard from further inside the mine.

Looking down the Mineshaft~
Be careful where you stand! The tunnel has widened out into a larger 
area. The surrounding crystal walls have been hacked back to allow space 
for the creation of a mineshaft. A huge hole dominates the center of the 
tunnel area; it has been cut out of the solid crystal packed floor. The shaft 
itself is extremely dark the further it goes down until eventually it 
disappears into nothingness. The crystals glitter all the way down the 
shaft but provide no immediate light to the surrounding area. The 
Goblins are busy lowering something down the shaft.

Deeper into the Green Crystal Mineshaft~
The Goblins, in their mindless efforts of lifting and lowering the wooden 
cart, have failed to notice you hitching a ride! You slowly descend into 
the darker depths of the mineshaft. The light is slowly receding above you, 
leaving only small sparkles from the crystals around you. The sounds of 
mining echo up from beneath you and the sounds of the creaking winches 
above you don't inspire confidence, you better hold on!

You have made it this far...A faint flickering glow of light begins to colour 
the mineshaft walls and you can begin to track your downward progress once 
again. The mineshaft walls are rough cut crystal shards, sticking at random 
angles. The crystals seem oddly muted the further down you go.

The wooden cart abruptly stops and you can hear the screaming and shout of 
the goblins above you. This little journey seems to have taken much longer 
than it should have. To your relief you can see, between the gaps between 
the walls and the cart, a flickering flame somewhere below you.

of the mineshaft. You can see the crystal tunnels veering off in every 
direction. Flaming torches line the walls at random intervals, creating a 
faint glow across the green crystal shards. The movement of the flames cast 
frightening shadows on the hard packed crystal floor. You can hear the 
sounds of falling crystals and frantic hacking from all directions.

You have taken the northern branch off the main mineshaft into a rough-cut
crystalline tunnel. The tunnels here are supported by thick, dark-wood 
beams at random intervals. The torches are mounted haphazardly onto the 
vertical beams, casting an eerie glow through the tunnel. As you walk, the
mining noises grow louder until you are suddenly surprised by a goblins
screams. The mining noises you heard earlier were not mining at all...the

becomes difficult to see. You try to manoeuvre carefully but the sharp 
crystals to either side seem to come closer. This tunnel is completely free 
of the miners, probably with good reason! From what you can see, the tunnel 
splits in two ahead.

crystallized miners seems to be carefully picking away at the crystal walls 
to the south.

A Southern Branch of the Narrowing Tunnel~
The tunnel becomes increasingly narrower as you walk. The light is 
beginning to fade and the crystals seem almost dull in the faded light,
losing their bright green hue. A couple of miners are chipping away 
carefully at the tunnel walls to either side. Unlike their fellows, they 
seem to be taking more care with what they are doing. There isnt much room
to swing a pick in this space. Probably a good thing, otherwise you might 
be in trouble.

An Odd End to the South Tunnel~
The light has almost completely gone and the air seems to thin, making it 
difficult to breathe. The walls close in around you, sharp crystals 
piercing your skin. The enclosed space allows you no further room to 
progress. It seems the miners have not continued to mine this section for 
some reason.
