the same weapon. He has thus haunted Hogwart's ever since, weaing his ghostly
chains as a form of penance.

are herbivores and are not known for fighting. As phoenixes approach their
burning day they resemble a half-plucked turkey. Their eyes become dull, their
feathers start to fall out, and it begins to make gagging noises. The the bird
suddenly bursts into flames only to rise from the ashes shortly after. In a
number of days, they grow back to full size. Hence, phoenixes are immortal.
