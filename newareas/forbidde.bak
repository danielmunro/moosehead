Forbidden Forest~
Very large cobwebs can be seen in the trees. By their size you really don't 
want to meet their owners. You haven't seen any insects or small birds around
for a long time so your not really sure what these webs catch that is good
to eat.

Forbidden Forest~
This area of the forest is darker than before. The giant trees reach high into the
sky, casting everything below into deep shadows. The undergrowth is not as thick
in this area and walking is easier. It is also much colder in this place. You
can see your breath as you walk.

Forbidden Forest~
A dark cave entrance is to the north. You feel a cold breeze flowing from it.
Gog, shadows, and cold is all you can see and feel and think about. It seems
you haven't seen sunlight for weeks. It can't get any worse.
