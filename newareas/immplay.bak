Stripe~
{DS{Wt{Dr{Wi{Dp{We{x~
Ugly vile creature stands here ready make lunch of you.
~
Stripe glares at you as you enter the room. He starts licking his sharp teeth as he runs his beady red eyes up and down your body. 
You can hardly tell a difference between him and the others all but the while strip of hair that he has running up his head. 
As you stare at him and watch his motions you can tell that he is by far the most dangerous gremlin and he is also the leader of them. 
You stare in amazement of how something so small could seem so dangerous, and then he turns and lunges for your throat and you know that this is not gonna turn out good.

wrath~
In an attempt to find the weakness of Heimdall, Loki, Heimdalls eternal nemesis, created a weapon
of such power that every known material was used in its forging. Such a weapon should have 
penetrated Heimdalls defences and provided Loki with the knowledge he needed for the final battle
between good and evil. Heimdall , knowing nothing of Lokis trickery was surprised when a mere 
mortal appeared carrying a blazing weapon and mindlessly attacked Heimdall. Heimdall brushed the
attack aside and crushed the blazing weapon in his grip. In his anger, he cast down the mortal being 
to his death from the heavens, but soon realized that no mortal could appear in the heavens without 
the assistance of another immortal. As a reminder to Heimdall of Lokis true nature and of mortals 
weaknesses, he kept the weapon on him at all times. It still sits within a sheath by his side, waiting 
for the day he can use it against Loki, for the longer it absorbs the good of Heimdall, the more sure
Heimdall will be that the weapon will be imbued enough to destroy Loki in the final battle. This is 
just another trial for both good and evil in the eternal struggle of the gods.

cake~
A cake made from... well... everything! It has smarties, jellybabies, 
popcorn, chocolate pieces and too many others to name! It's coated with
multi-colored icing suger. Ice cream cones are sticking out of it at angles 
and it has about fifteen huge layers, creating a rather precarious tower of 
deliciousness. Twenty huge candles are mounted on the top of the cake... 
for those who can fly... like Mindweaver, they can see she's still a young 
lass. Word of caution... don't start from the bottom.
